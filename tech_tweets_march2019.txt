ElonMusk--30 Mar--Weve been so mired in production &amp; logistics for past 18 months. Really looking fwd to getting Semi into production.
ElonMusk--30 Mar--Tesla Semi delivering Tesla cars https://t.co/ttEpcW5d8G
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@saraccbleitao @Tesla Pre-Happy birthday!
ElonMusk--30 Mar--Amazing work by Tesla Delivery teams, especially in Europe &amp; China! Most insane logistics challenge Ive ever seen. Thanks also to many country &amp; city officials for your help this weekend! Super appreciated.
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@MoWo91 Coming soon!
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@sdpilgrim No
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@Teslarati Wow

ElonMusk--30 Mar--This might be my finest work
ElonMusk--30 Mar--Duck emoji defeats Emo G Records. Crushing victory.
ElonMusk--30 Mar--Im disappointed that my record label failed
ElonMusk--30 Mar--Emo G Records https://t.co/zsuB2NDl48 https://t.co/anVkKeFMGr
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@TechVelocirap @FewellJacob @WorldAndScience Instagram comments are coding in emojis
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@FewellJacob @WorldAndScience Also true
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@HConcience @WorldAndScience True
ElonMusk--30 Mar--The quality of emojis varies wildly
ElonMusk--30 Mar--Lame
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@WorldAndScience C++ syntax sucks
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@WorldAndScience Assert (Money == Series of heterogeneous databases insecurely connected with high latency. Primary purpose == Information system for allocation of human time. As automation++, value of money--);
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Even connectivity at my house in Silicon Valley sucks!
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@marshgre @NickBre58305797 @letsrebel1 @paul_rocchini @markbspiegel @Tesla Like the movie Us. Scary  but also empathetic.
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@martinengwicht @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag @Ula No, but for sure the other way around!
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@TesLatino @mcjamez @TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag @Tesla Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you cant hear, but you can feel in your chest
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Were going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey.
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy cant. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but thats very rare.
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last years vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying.
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see whats there. Not impossible.
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@emilmelar Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, its slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2.
ElonMusk--30 Mar--@MacBenTosh Anyone who bought FSD will get it
ElonMusk--29 Mar--Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward HW3 will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important. https://t.co/lICMpT7xnX
ElonMusk--29 Mar--@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Yes. Sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.
ElonMusk--29 Mar--@Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow.
ElonMusk--29 Mar--@DiscoverMag We should send probes to outer solar system &amp; get high res, true color images of these strange things. Maybe theres an alien artifact out there 
ElonMusk--29 Mar--@erinwinick @techreview Super cool!
ElonMusk--29 Mar--@martin_galway Good point
ElonMusk--29 Mar--@ialexryan Tax authorities tend to interpret things in their favor, but it sure sounds like you could be right! Will investigate.
ElonMusk--28 Mar--@GerberKawasaki Rare use case, but it is possible. There are complications with this. Eary prototype Roadsters had this ability.
ElonMusk--28 Mar--@ChadyMattar Exactly
ElonMusk--27 Mar--@briantu Super proud of Tesla Autopilot team!
ElonMusk--27 Mar--@_DavidMacMillan No, it is one week either way.
ElonMusk--27 Mar--@jose_goncalves_ 
ElonMusk--26 Mar--@Erdayastronaut @NASA @VP I think so. For sure worth giving it our best shot! Would be great to have a competitive, commercial program to build a moon base that is outcome-oriented (not cost-plus), so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo.
ElonMusk--26 Mar--@NASA @VP It would be so inspiring for humanity to see humanity return to the moon!
ElonMusk--26 Mar--@RamLover69 12,000 lbs!? How puny. Do you construct childrens toys?

ElonMusk--26 Mar--@zachary1978 @Tesla Good point
ElonMusk--26 Mar--Hard to appreciate how much Tesla Autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it https://t.co/Giqb2WLVAb
ElonMusk--26 Mar--@SkiddlyBinx Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained. Yes, but were going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads.
ElonMusk--26 Mar--@thejimos Glad you like it! Navigate on Autopilot hopefully approved for Europe soon.
ElonMusk--26 Mar--Thank you! https://t.co/vh4zujXiZ4

ElonMusk--24 Mar--To be clear, this doesnt affect Tesla website order prices. Existing inventory prices are currently slightly lower than on website. This will bring them in line.
ElonMusk--24 Mar--To be precise, midnight on April 1, so effective April 2
ElonMusk--24 Mar--Please note prices on all Tesla inventory cars worldwide rise by ~3% on April 1

ElonMusk--17 Mar--@SidewalkSciGuy @SpacexFan9876 @Erdayastronaut @Sloppy93 @annerajb @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium &amp; carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint.
ElonMusk--17 Mar--@Some1gg Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing.  Zero refurbishment.
ElonMusk--17 Mar--@Kristennetten No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps

ElonMusk--17 Mar--@Sloppy93 @Erdayastronaut @annerajb @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Only some of the hottest sections
ElonMusk--17 Mar--@annerajb @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Full size
ElonMusk--17 Mar--@annerajb @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Dont need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
ElonMusk--17 Mar--@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.
ElonMusk--17 Mar--@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.
ElonMusk--17 Mar--@THE_REAL_KEAGAN @Tesla @LikeTeslaKim @BenSullins @teslainventory Agreed
ElonMusk--17 Mar--@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. Were simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.
ElonMusk--17 Mar--@omarqazi @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout 
ElonMusk--17 Mar--@flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely.
ElonMusk--17 Mar--@austinbarnard45 First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.
ElonMusk--17 Mar--@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Goes against interests of all Texans
ElonMusk--17 Mar--@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Wow, this is crazy
ElonMusk--16 Mar--@NuovaRealta If someone really wants to return the car in good faith on day 8, thats fine
ElonMusk--16 Mar--To be clear, orders are fully refundable, even after youve had your Tesla for a week
ElonMusk--16 Mar--Reminder to buy our S3XY cars before midnight on Monday! Prices rise slightly worldwide on Tuesday. You can order online at https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr.
ElonMusk--16 Mar--@AskDrStupid @vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Yes!
ElonMusk--16 Mar--@lexiheft @vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Definitely down the road, once construction &amp; upgrades arent so crazy
ElonMusk--16 Mar--@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes dont actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.
ElonMusk--16 Mar--@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production
ElonMusk--16 Mar--@dave_ross @Tesla Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer
ElonMusk--16 Mar--@TrevorMahlmann @Tesla @PopMech Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but thats a lot of complexity.
ElonMusk--16 Mar--@ColinRossUBC827 @Tesla @PopMech Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isnt critical for snowy regions.
ElonMusk--16 Mar--@Tesla @PopMech Still get this question a lot, even though Norway  has highest Tesla cars per person on  (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice.

ElonMusk--12 Mar--@TonyTesla4Life @tesla_truth @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla Correct
ElonMusk--12 Mar--@fredsa @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla Thats the plan
ElonMusk--12 Mar--@Syntality @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla Of course
ElonMusk--12 Mar--@brandynspears 6
ElonMusk--12 Mar--@FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla In retrospect, lower price shouldnt have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldnt afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday.
ElonMusk--12 Mar--@johnny0129 However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak
ElonMusk--12 Mar--@johnny0129 We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference  about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board.
ElonMusk--12 Mar--@jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought dont want to write Tesla a check. So it goes.
ElonMusk--12 Mar--@soundanswer @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell Yes
ElonMusk--12 Mar--@marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too
ElonMusk--12 Mar--Applies worldwide
ElonMusk--12 Mar--@vincent13031925 Yes

ElonMusk--11 Mar--@cleantechnica True
ElonMusk--09 Mar--@Drew78823936 @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @RocketTenor @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Probably right. Starship rate of progress far exceeds Falcon &amp; Dragon, although theyre critical to getting there. dInnovation/dt is what matters long-term.
ElonMusk--09 Mar--@DJSnM @RocketTenor @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew For cargo missions, propulsive land landing should be no problem. Doesnt have same safety criticality as crew.
ElonMusk--09 Mar--@dmk184 @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Pretty much any moon or planet that has a solid or liquid surface
ElonMusk--09 Mar--@iamkostmos @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Most likely, but this is contingent upon NASA review &amp; approval
ElonMusk--09 Mar--@xandriteme @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Best to use a giant brake pad, aka heat shield
ElonMusk--09 Mar--@ajithshan03 @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew No

ElonMusk--07 Mar--@comeaujo @ValueAnalyst1 @Tesla Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays &amp; updated software with battery warmup results in &gt;2X improvement in fleet charge time
ElonMusk--07 Mar--@flcnhvy We will spend 3 or 6 months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues &amp; then begin buildout worldwide.
ElonMusk--07 Mar--Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case &amp; more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput.
ElonMusk--07 Mar--Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%. https://t.co/h2MMBjkzLu

ElonMusk--07 Mar--@compdemon Ukraine did play a major role
ElonMusk--07 Mar--@Erdayastronaut @privater @marc_benton @Teslatunity @Model3Owners @Tesla Very little power &amp; only right before you get to the Supercharger. You wont notice it in range.
ElonMusk--07 Mar--@privater @marc_benton @Teslatunity @Model3Owners @Tesla If you navigate to Supercharger, car will warm up battery en route, so you start immediately at max power

ElonMusk--02 Mar--@raulv48 @bryanMackSC @Tesla Were trying to make EVs &amp; autonomy more affordable over time. This is the right thing to do. However, we cannot then also retroactively make earlier buyers whole without killing the company.
ElonMusk--02 Mar--@Sofiaan @royalflushGK Will take a few days for system update
ElonMusk--02 Mar--@TonyCrisostomo @tesla_truth @royalflushGK Yeah, we need a few days to update the system. If anyone already paid $3k, they should get $1k back.
ElonMusk--02 Mar--@abhaygupta @royalflushGK Its not exactly symmetric, but it will come with HW3 upgrade long-term
ElonMusk--02 Mar--@royalflushGK If you bought enhanced autopilot, FSD upgrade costs $2k instead of $5k
ElonMusk--02 Mar--If you bought a Tesla before yesterdays price reduction, you can have Autopilot or full self-driving at half normal cost (up to $6k less) https://t.co/2cKXmmSsJa
ElonMusk--02 Mar--@Kristennetten @sivarajkumar237 He is the sensor!
ElonMusk--02 Mar--@sivarajkumar237 Nope, hes going to float around in zero gravity
ElonMusk--02 Mar--Super high tech zero-g indicator added just before launch! https://t.co/CRO26plaXq
ElonMusk--02 Mar--@Secrethamper @HugsForNoah Happy birthday!
ElonMusk--01 Mar--@Jay_Marquez Yeah, just use a dryer outlet. High power, easy to install &amp; low cost.
ElonMusk--01 Mar--@Model3Owners @TroyTeslike Explanation from Tesla later today
ElonMusk--01 Mar--@ErdayastronaBillGates--29 Mar--Pivot Bio has developed an alternative to synthetic fertilizer that could help transform farming and reduce greenhouse gas emissions: https://t.co/3keIlFe2MR https://t.co/iAdaBmKFVI
BillGates--28 Mar--Im thrilled that senators from both sides of the aisle have come together to support advanced nuclear. This is exactly the kind of leadership our country needs to both solve the climate challenge and reassert our leadership in this important industry.
BillGates--28 Mar--Nuclear energy is one of these critical technologies. Its ideal for dealing with climate change, because it is the only carbon-free, scalable energy source thats available 24 hours a day.
BillGates--28 Mar--To prevent the worst effects of climate change, we need to reach near-zero emissions on all the things that drive itagriculture, electricity, manufacturing, transportation, and buildingsby investing in innovation across all sectors while deploying low cost renewables.
BillGates--28 Mar--Yesterday, a bipartisan group of leaders in the U.S. Senate introduced the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, which establishes an ambitious plan to accelerate the development of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. I cant overstate how important this is. https://t.co/tRovGTm2sg
BillGates--26 Mar--We need to reach zero net emissions from every sector of the economy including agriculture (which, along with forestry, and land use, is responsible for almost as much greenhouse gas emissions as electricity). https://t.co/Sioivi1R9L
BillGates--26 Mar--Most discussions about fighting climate change focus on electricity and the need for renewable energy. De-carbonizing the way we generate electricity would be a huge step, but it wont be enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. https://t.co/C4oCIz6iXg
BillGates--25 Mar--Five years ago, India was declared poliofree. Whenever someone asks me how they did it, I tell them about one of the countrys lowest castes: the Musahar. https://t.co/X6AZTigffl https://t.co/I2Ija5AyKY
BillGates--24 Mar--Im inspired by Azim Premjis continued commitment to philanthropy. His latest contribution will make a tremendous impact. https://t.co/IOTiHxtivw
BillGates--22 Mar--Thanks to the incredible work of goat nurses, thousands of women in India have an opportunity to lift themselves and their families out of poverty: https://t.co/KzLMfLz5Um https://t.co/6pWqbFRLAT
BillGates--21 Mar--.@SueDHellmann recently sat down with @CDCFound to talk about how our foundation measures the impact of our partners and grantees. Its worth a listen: https://t.co/DJkkrX2Ytj https://t.co/ptBtRPBaXM
BillGates--20 Mar--Meet the goat nurses, an incredible team of health workers who help women gain financial independence by raising healthier goats. https://t.co/9yiSjvg7tL
BillGates--18 Mar--2019 marks 150 years since the creation of the periodic table. Whenever people visit my office, I like to show them my favorite version. Its made out of samples of each element, and reminds me every day of why Im so fascinated by science and technology: https://t.co/d5sYO9ehUE https://t.co/1dVHpF9jCg
BillGates--17 Mar--If you believe innovation is for everyone, then I have a list for you: 10 challenges that the world needs your ideas to help solve. https://t.co/fnV9s61Lk3

BillGates--15 Mar--If you want to discover what makes a school great, theres no substitute for spending time in the classroom. I learned a lot from the students and teachers at this Chicago school: https://t.co/hN6zJEnjQW https://t.co/pL5cHJCejq
BillGates--14 Mar--Medical advances should be available to everyone who needs them. Thats why Im excited about an inexpensive blood test that could help doctors predict if a baby will be born prematurely. This information would undoubtedly save lives. https://t.co/GsCYZU7gqs
BillGates--13 Mar--Its great to see leaders in Washington talking about accelerating energy innovation to fight climate change. This op-ed from @lisamurkowski and @Sen_JoeManchin is worth reading. https://t.co/Z45BIXBLVq
BillGates--12 Mar--I was lucky to be a young person when the digital revolution was just getting under way, and my Microsoft colleagues and I had the chance to help shape it. Celebrating #Web30 leaves me feeling nostalgic about 1995. https://t.co/krIFxTGd1q
BillGates--10 Mar--Behind every progress report is a student story. As Yusef  a senior at North-Grand High School in Chicago  told me, he is seeing himself clearly in ways he couldnt before thanks to better data about his progress: https://t.co/zlGlEZPZPE https://t.co/yeKQdwXL9T
BillGates--08 Mar--When I visited Ethiopia last month, I was impressed by the governments commitment to gender equality. Ethiopian President @SahleWorkZewde explains why lifting up women benefits everyone. https://t.co/XCc6IXqRa2
BillGates--08 Mar--Melindas work on behalf of women and girls inspires me every day. I love this video she made for #IWD2019 https://t.co/1CeWYGPTAv
BillGates--07 Mar--Tomorrow is #IWD2019  a day when we celebrate the progress made by and for women. To celebrate, @melindagates is sharing a chapter from her new book, The Moment of Lift, about the lessons shes learned from women around the world. https://t.co/im5O3CRRaQ
BillGates--06 Mar--I recently visited a high school that has gone from one of Chicagos worst to one of its best: https://t.co/1GaU7pLcSs https://t.co/wHMDnmVJjF
BillGates--05 Mar--By embracing data, research, and community, schools have an opportunity to help students succeed in high school, college, and beyond. https://t.co/Yzcgxi47S3

BillGates--02 Mar--I was excited when I thought @MarkRober brought me a hamburger. Turns out it was a bottle of swamp water https://t.co/nwiluClsWt
BillGates--01 Mar--Reading is my favorite way to learn about a new subject. Here are 10 books that have shaped how Im thinking about technology today. https://t.co/J7UqIkRSHM
JeffWeiner--23 Mar--Sometimes successful product breakthroughs happen overnight and sometimes they take years to develop. A hugely undervalued talent is knowing how long to wait before trying something else.
JeffWeiner--19 Mar--@slifkin @AndrewYangVFA Dave, the timing of your tweet is uncanny. Literally just finished catching up on his last three or four media appearances. Andrew is a friend. When he first told me he was running I thought he had lost it. Now believe hes going to make UBI a serious part of the 20 dialog.
JeffWeiner--17 Mar--Imagine Duke 30 sec timeouts go something like the following: Coach K: Feed the ball to Zion [long pause] So whos watching the final season of Game of Thrones?
JeffWeiner--16 Mar--@mkhoury Whoa. You werent kidding.
JeffWeiner--16 Mar--@mkhoury You just did. :)
JeffWeiner--16 Mar--@Sean1927 @jake330614 As impressive as young Lebron was, he was moving with 30-40 lbs less.

JeffWeiner--08 Mar--@levie @tim_cook Two can play at that game: Jeff 
JeffWeiner--07 Mar--Have seen a lot of singing competition shows over the years but have never seen an audition like this before. Very cool to watch the moment a true virtuoso is discovered https://t.co/nDcoDi3zqY https://t.co/UOfpAS2eXM

AndrewNg--18 Mar--While having pie for Pi Day last Thursday, inspiration struck. We enjoy AI, we enjoy pie, and we want to share both with more people. Introducing Pie &amp; AI: a @deeplearningai_ meetup series. Sign up so youll know when were coming to your town! https://t.co/VOSBQedKXE https://t.co/ib5PcJ2cQZ
AndrewNg--18 Mar--One of the (many) reasons AI research is progressing faster than ever is that there're now more people doing AI research than at any other point in history. This is a wonderful trend, and lets keep welcoming more people into AI! AndrewNg--14 Mar--Happy Pi Day everyone! Trying to read a research paper, but surprisingly hard to focus when wondering what flavor of pie we're getting. 
AndrewNg--14 Mar--New result from our @Stanford lab! Instead of giving everyone the same treatment, you can use ML to predict who would benefit from high blood pressure treatment and who wouldn't. @tonyduan_ @pranavrajpurkar @DillonLaird, and Sanjay Basu. Details here: https://t.co/G1nbg2Ug7I
AndrewNg--12 Mar--Thanks to Tom's work on the CMU face recognition dataset, this gif of me now exists on the internet forever.  https://t.co/TM0I5uXPFM
AndrewNg--12 Mar--It was great catching up with @CarnegieMellon's Prof @Tommmitchell at the Landing AI office. I've know him since my undergrad days at CMU, and we had fun reminiscing on what @deanpomerleau's 1994 Neural Networks course was like! https://t.co/EdEXfnn9FK
AndrewNg--06 Mar--Announcing https://t.co/Ryb1M38abX's newest specialization, TensorFlow: From Basics to Mastery! In partnership with @TensorFlow team. To be great at implementing AI, you need to know how to best use ML frameworks like TF. @deeplearningai_ Take Course 1: https://t.co/Aa9WZLYsNq https://t.co/LSUDI90GpQ

AndrewNg--05 Mar--AI for Everyone was designed as a 4 week course, but 252 learners have already finished the whole thing! Congrats to all 252 of you.  I don't recommend "cramming" everything into one day, but it is possible to do the whole thing quickly if you want.
MarquesBrownlee--30 Mar--@Tim_Stevens True, I guess I just wish the regular pockets were better haha
MarquesBrownlee--30 Mar--I still don't know why exactly these spikes happen sometimes, but these are the views on my first ever video over the last week. WHY DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO SEE BABY MARQUES, YOUTUBE ALGORITHM? https://t.co/8Z8surjZJ7

MarquesBrownlee--30 Mar--@BrandonJHavard 
MarquesBrownlee--30 Mar--@SnazzyQ But for phones tho? The weight hitting you in the ribs isn't awkward?
MarquesBrownlee--30 Mar--Someone should invent a suit where the pockets aren't all weird sizes so I don't have to keep my phone in the jacket pocket where it's awkward to reach. That is all. https://t.co/2849UJf00I

MarquesBrownlee--28 Mar--@JasonTLewisPHT Yes of course. Struggles to hear any difference between new AP1 and new AP2. A lot of people seem to either be falling for a place effect or they're comparing old, crusty AirPods with new ones. Apple confirmed no difference.
MarquesBrownlee--28 Mar--@theMrMobile Happy Birthday man!

MarquesBrownlee--25 Mar--@Mr_Beasley7 Nothing, just imagine Oprah, Steven Spielberg, Aquama, Bigbird and Tim Cook in the same room
MarquesBrownlee--25 Mar--That green room backstage must be absolutely insane
MarquesBrownlee--25 Mar--Ok we did actually get a trailer. That 30-second montage was designed to sell us on AppleTV+ and thats it! No price announced (bold). Coming this fall.
MarquesBrownlee--25 Mar--Since Apple seems to have nothing to show from these shows theyre teasing, I think it wouldve been way more dramatic to have all these stars just walk on stage at the same time and say nothing for 10 seconds  in front of an Apple logo then leave.
MarquesBrownlee--25 Mar--@tldtoday @SaraBareilles One of them will appreciate the lens flare lol
MarquesBrownlee--25 Mar--This is the YouTube Rewind of Netflix competition.
MarquesBrownlee--25 Mar--I can tell Im supposed to be swayed by all the star-power on stage but I dont watch enough TV to care, so this is pretty chill.

MarquesBrownlee--18 Mar--@esoarespt Testing. Lots of testing. Also the fact that my car has gotten a dozen plus successful software improvements in the past. Im sure regulation will catch up, but theres no doubt theres a major upside here.
MarquesBrownlee--18 Mar--@esoarespt Despite the incredible article/application we just witnessed?
MarquesBrownlee--18 Mar--@Im_RahulSharma @zte Technically true
MarquesBrownlee--18 Mar--@OngakuGaming Imagine a smartphone getting a software update and ask yourself all the same questions.
MarquesBrownlee--18 Mar--@SnazzyQ I think literally shipping a free USB stick and firmware install instructions to every owner in the world might even be better than that lol
MarquesBrownlee--18 Mar--@nickf7500 I mean you could always not install the update lol
MarquesBrownlee--18 Mar--Tesla Remotely Increases Power Output of all Model 3s via Software Update so Model 3 owners just woke up to a car with faster acceleration and a higher top speed than when they went to sleep.

KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@brianmcarney @EricRWeinstein @joerogan @seanmcarroll @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @sapinker @DrDebraSoh This is fair
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@EricRWeinstein @joerogan @seanmcarroll @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @sapinker @DrDebraSoh D) well having Alex Jones and then not challenging him much is not so dandy and kind of sucks up all the oxygen. And Milo, well, thats certainly complex. But you gotta know when you have Jones on what youre doing and need to grok the obvi react
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@EricRWeinstein @joerogan @seanmcarroll @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @sapinker @DrDebraSoh C) I do not perceive trump lovers, but more an exhausting fixation on being heard when you all are very loud. I assume the politics runs the gamut tho. Anyways gotta go visit my Trump-loving bro (he def is!)
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@EricRWeinstein @joerogan @seanmcarroll @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @sapinker @DrDebraSoh B) so what is a good answer to much
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@EricRWeinstein @joerogan @seanmcarroll @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @sapinker @DrDebraSoh A) seemed like it had more of an issue with Alex Jones interview than painting anyone else that badly and I am good with that part.
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@EricRWeinstein @thekidz2r @joerogan @seanmcarroll @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @sapinker @DrDebraSoh Sure
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@Epiceclectic @Mysteryjellocat @joerogan Zzzzzzzz. What? Did you say something?
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@RcktsTV @mattholomew @joerogan I totally agree
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@EricRWeinstein @thekidz2r @joerogan @seanmcarroll @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @sapinker @DrDebraSoh Right now my kids are playing Juice Worlds new album (it is actually great, but not for hours) on endless loop, so very little will bother me for weeks.
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@EricRWeinstein @thekidz2r @joerogan @seanmcarroll @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @sapinker @DrDebraSoh Thats gallant of you Eric. I almost always reply. In all seriousness, am going to find you dozens of what are essentially reviews of both right and left interviewers. The ones on Kathy Lee Gifford by Tom Shales pre Internet  now that was tough.
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@Epiceclectic @Mysteryjellocat @joerogan Sounds like the right does the same thing with these tired narratives. In other words echo chamber meet echo chamber.
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@thekidz2r @EricRWeinstein @joerogan @seanmcarroll @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @sapinker @DrDebraSoh Um no. But youre def a dope.
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@joshuavoydik @EricRWeinstein @joerogan @seanmcarroll @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @sapinker @DrDebraSoh And yes he is self deprecating
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@joshuavoydik @EricRWeinstein @joerogan @seanmcarroll @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @sapinker @DrDebraSoh I think he is just fine. I did not read that it calls him dumb and it is clear he is not. Watching him recently, hes very amusing and has a fun jam. I would mostly say he can be very light on pushback of some hot take hacks he has in but that is not uncommon.
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@Epiceclectic @joerogan Seems like the right is the side that goes all soft when it comes to even mild criticism. But keep up your noisy little narrative about the left.
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@EricRWeinstein @joerogan @seanmcarroll @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @sapinker @DrDebraSoh Read it again. Its mildly critical and has some cogent points. You dont have to agree but it is hardly stalker or hate.
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@EricRWeinstein @joerogan @seanmcarroll @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @sapinker @DrDebraSoh Its hardly a hit piece. This story is no different than critiques I have read for decades. What you dont like is that prominence comes with scrutiny. Its a long life, so if you want to be out there and speak loud, slagging critics will become tiresome.
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--What IS in the box? Is the box gift wrapped?  https://t.co/NpWvL7jHNZ

KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@timrace Thx for liking the actual point though
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@timrace Not sure saying I was dead right in 1998 about a major tech shift (I was, read the story) is self congratulatory. Its just true. But whatev. Signed, Carol Danvers
KaraSwisher--23 Mar--@EricRWeinstein @joerogan @seanmcarroll @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg @sapinker @DrDebraSoh Cant stand the heat, Eric? Good lord you put yourself out there, you get critiqued. It does not call you a dullard, although who cares if it did.

KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@jnptl @AdamSinger Well we will see. Life does change with autonomous everywhere it goes
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@MitTsoy Hello

KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@BlairReeves @pwilldotorg @AdamSinger Agreed
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@BlairReeves @pwilldotorg @AdamSinger People thought that about a lot of stuff. Anyways I am just bringing up the idea for debate. Stuff going on in China is riveting

KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@ARJWright Thx!
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@parismarx @AsherDeMontreal @schmangee @humantransit @JennRice_Geog Well DiDi in China and grab in SE Asia have some interesting offerings
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@parismarx @AsherDeMontreal @schmangee @humantransit @JennRice_Geog You should see what they are doing in China. More people, more people with limited means, more creative choices
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@ohohorganic @profgalloway Yes Columbia J School has courses in both
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@parismarx @AsherDeMontreal @schmangee @humantransit @JennRice_Geog It should not be for a privileged few
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@billmcneely Agreed we need creative public and private solutions
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@IdeationFoundry Oh I like it

KaraSwisher--22 Mar--The last time I heard the word mendacity used so well was by Burl Ives as Big Daddy in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Theres nothing to live with but mendacity. https://t.co/Swl6IyE60S https://t.co/aF4UfUssMa
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--Doubling down is one move. https://t.co/lDFkCAHvRY
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@joshuajordison Thx. Appreciate you get my goal! Which is always a genuine convo.
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@mboverell Yeah I liked that line. Mostly: So many grifters.
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@srsaliba @joerogan Oh I doubt I am his type considering the guests. They are all the same round peg gang and I would be that square peg he speaks of.
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@NYTDaniel @joerogan @SusanWojcicki As usual you are an idiot. I like the show and you are making up your toddler version of persecution.
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@gul_garak @joerogan It is a fairer article than you think. Read it again. And while I get the appeal and really like the jam he has going on, he does tolerate grifters and bullshit thinkers a lot. He seems smarter than that, but he often lets them off the hook.
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@gul_garak @joerogan There are tons of excellent long form interview shows out there, so pretending all that is out there is mainstream media being empty or whatever is just not so. You can like him but I find it fascinating you need to make a straw man to do that.
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--Woah. Mother of Dragons indeed: Emilia Clarke, of Game of Thrones, on Surviving Two Life-Threatening Aneurysms https://t.co/mtBdEX4nS3

KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@meansderek @jaredkushner @WhatsApp Ha
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@cspamus1 @joerogan Oh thats not fair. he is funny. I thought this showed that and also the lack of pressing of interviewees (which a lot of people do, from Ellen to all the late night guys, so not going to give him the hardest time either).
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@AnthonyQuintano @vijaya @jack Thx for troll hunting.
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@gul_garak @joerogan Oh good lord. Get one degree out of your comfort zone and you cant take it. Its completely fair.
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--@profgalloway @tomcatalini You wish
KaraSwisher--22 Mar--Fascinating analysis here of the @joerogan show with these gems of writing: https://t.co/QEGLPgVhBR https://t.co/ybfBTQPOYb
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--Read @pkafka tweeps. He is smarter than us all. https://t.co/Z63Zi3FC1A
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--What my dude @DelRey said https://t.co/qcDj2BEVdZ
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@mattkaness @DelRey @GregBensinger Jason is a treasure and the post is spending a ton of dough on tech reporters.
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@colbyreade @JohnCarreyrou Well we like to not be stupid about stuff we are not experts in. Crazy I know! We really might have fallen into the Holmes $$ hype too, since it was a lot of big tech investors, so glad we passed. Really by accident!
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@matthausmann I will read that book
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@ricardodsanchez @ProductHunt I am without capital! But ok!
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@colbyreade To be fair, I never covered that company and Recode did not. Glad we did not as we had no expertise like @JohnCarreyrou obvi did.
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@ewlamy @alcal74 @Recode @JohnCarreyrou Yes I am also responsible for Trump
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@FluttrSocial Yes
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@alcal74 @Recode @JohnCarreyrou Happy to take blame when we screw up. But youre wrong about Recode. We didnt cover Theranos, since we hardly cover healthcare and we never had Holmes on our stages either. We lacked expertise and reporters on the subject to judge this, but John did and he did do a great job.
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@randallgts Thx

KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@coleharmonson @katzish @invisiblepeople Hmm
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@rpetty Admitting you are a sloppy dope. Thats a new one!
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@republicinexile @rpetty Thx for trying but they have their dopey narcissistic faux narrative they need to stick to. Also, though @waltmossberg rocks, this clown has clearly not followed my stuff since a decade ago.

KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@dgp @BarbMcQuade ;)
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@IWantToBeAGMO The show? Really? Thats hardly corruption. Lots of kids of pols do that. Who cares? Come on. Not even comparable to the ongoing grifter kleptocracy fest of the Trumps and their pals.
KaraSwisher--21 Mar--@IWantToBeAGMO They are hardly benefiting. Its a groundless accusation.

KaraSwisher--20 Mar--@filmboy Oh no
KaraSwisher--20 Mar--@FawningGirl Its my opinion and I cant. So full stop. Your types pontificate on all kinds of stuff (like my opinion) and never shut up, so what if I have an opinion? Honestly, get another rage to rage about
KaraSwisher--20 Mar--@Sr_Lazarus @kimmaicutler @TheFrisc I know who you are
KaraSwisher--20 Mar--@wagedj Hmm I disagree

KaraSwisher--20 Mar--@mateopearson Ha. Ask @Sulliview!
KaraSwisher--20 Mar--@earcity Yes I do. I think they cover women candidates differently
KaraSwisher--20 Mar--@Sr_Lazarus @kimmaicutler Ok soon! A topic I will return to
KaraSwisher--20 Mar--@Sr_Lazarus Ok then!
KaraSwisher--20 Mar--@eddiecohn You want @CaseyNewton not me
KaraSwisher--20 Mar--@Sulliview @freerangejane What she said except me being in her company
KaraSwisher--20 Mar--@FuckleyB Do you have decades? Its changing but please use your eyes.
KaraSwisher--20 Mar--@earcity Its not. Its just an astonishing lot of the same kind of people. It matters. See Brie Larson on movie reviewers. Same thing
KaraSwisher--20 Mar--@earcity Come on.
KaraSwisher--20 Mar--@royklumensah @Recode Um it was a lie
KaraSwisher--20 Mar--You can hear my latest interview with @vestager  just a week ago @sxsw  here: https://t.co/w77GpZkdqM

KaraSwisher--19 Mar--The rumor that @realDonaldTrump introduced @parscale to the making up of provable lies is a complete non-fabrication. Just more #FoxNews. The mainstream media wants you to believe this, because its, um, true. Truth couldnt pick Brad out of a lineup. https://t.co/UhbJZwuOHU

KaraSwisher--19 Mar--@bradleybrad Not sure that is right. She really does get stuff done. But def tough to penetrate motivations as a subject
KaraSwisher--19 Mar--@stevealter I need to look at it. Heard the Fb stuff was raw
KaraSwisher--19 Mar--We all know @realDonaldTrump turned down @parscale for a job as Twitter double he desperately wanted. He barely did the one below and either sucked/stunk, didnt want the scrutiny? Now he hurts @gtconway3d because he is jealous of his styling tweets. @jack doesnt even know him! https://t.co/HIfZME5Q3r
KaraSwisher--19 Mar--In related news, everything about @LindseyGrahamSCs service has been diminished by his own quisling behavior that has only damaged the memory of his longtime mentor and friend @SenJohnMcCain.

KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@MartinJournal @heykmenz The quote was dopey
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@realswordawg @em_div You do realize he is hyping this. I did not ask the ceo of youtube to ban him. But whatever.
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@jp101 True. But he still chafes me!
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@mikeeisenberg Well then it would be nice if you could ask me rather than take the word of someone who trolls.
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@mikeeisenberg No, no meant I was not suggesting that she remove him, which was what I was asked. He has broken no rules at all, so why would she?
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@mikeeisenberg Yes it said I would but I cant. I meant I would not host it. But I do not run the service. The no, no is the answer to her asking if I thought she should.
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@TheKJohnson @kathygriffin Me either
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@MiriamJunge @Headspace @andypuddicombe @richardpierson Yay
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@mikeeisenberg I simply do not like either of those clowns and the content they produce. So what? I dont like a lot of stuff. But they hate when people reject their silly song and dance and live to pick look-at-me fights.
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@mikeeisenberg also on a previous interview I clearly pressed Susan on the ban of Alex Jones and clearly said she should ban him because he violated the rules on the platform. Here I just said I would not have them on my platform but that she should not ban them. Good lord.
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@mikeeisenberg These people use exhausting indignation and the ignoring of what was actually said (I said I would not host them, but clearly said Susan should not ban them) to make their dopey narratives. They are clowns, but the creepy kind.
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@mikeeisenberg Why in the world then would you tweet without checking? Super irksome. The transcript is on the Recode web site or you can listen to the podcast. I was specifically referring to the way youtube recommends videos and how it becomes a scary wormhole with certain videos.
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@need_later Yeah I cant. What do you care since I dont run YouTube? But I clearly said she should not ban when she asked if that was what I was saying (is the no, no too hard for your to grok?). also my son watched a videos, I did not say he liked them (he did not)
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@mikeeisenberg This is crap, Mike, by hot take hacks, and it would be nice if you actually read the transcript since you actually know me. I simply said I did not like their stuff and would not host it. I do not run YouTube. When Susan asked if I thought she should ban, I said clearly: No, no.
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@sillmanc Its not. He was saying I asked her to do it and I did not. In fact, I said no, no. And who cares what I would hypothetically do
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@TommyIgoe @FoxNews They will not
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@gabemott Huh? I do not think he is.
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@RealFacelessMan Not complex but these dudes need to do their exhausting indignant dance that some lady does not like their stuff and says so.
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@RealFacelessMan @benshapiro @SusanWojcicki I was talking about how the next video recommended works and does not work. My son never watched Peterson. He was just recommended next and if my kid wanted to watch, he could (no interest he told me). It was how really problematic stuff then was soon surfaced.
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--Read by the very best @nitashatiku: How Google Influences the Conversation in Washington https://t.co/ze6T2a5XgP
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--Wow this thread by @gtconway3d https://t.co/rOgGalsnsG
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@scarfire1978 Thx!
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@jackomo Ouch
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@Justin_G0rd0n Naw. Its been months of this stuff. Sorry!
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--Read this. Also @brielarson rocks: https://t.co/85GHLxRK9L via @NYTimes
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@LisaMcerlaneYao @EricaAmerica @chadmumm No!
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@BariAWilliams Mirrotocracy
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--Even if said on a shock jock show, hard to imagine what lame excuse Tucky is going to make now for these deeply creepy remarks that he has so far brushed off as simply naughty: Tucker Carlson's comments about Miss Teen USA contestant cause outrage  https://t.co/aJ4aLPwmMm
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--Heh https://t.co/HiGEuF31mn
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--What she said. Honestly, the whole man-boy act of this dude is already tiresome to me. https://t.co/AErIFEMDWD
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@evleaks Yeah.
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@evleaks I blame the parents here. It never would have happened without them
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@MarlinRushing @profgalloway Yes!
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@Gunny_83 @SusanWojcicki @benshapiro And typical of the left? Please. I guess then typical of the right not to just let you dislike their stuff without their making it all about trying to centsor them. The false indignation is exhausting.
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@Gunny_83 @SusanWojcicki @benshapiro Hey dude, is there content you just do not like? I thought so. Me too. But I also never stopped my kid from sampling varied stuff online either, even stuff I dislike. Btw he likes the memes making light of people more than he likes any of this content anyway.
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@dontaemears Thx
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@KarenCahn @kathygriffin Thx!
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@em_div Thx!
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@TommyIgoe @Peggynoonannyc Whatever. As I said, the tweet floor is hers if she needs

KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@kangaroo5383 @jenbmiller Not always
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@macbrass Fair point
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@kangaroo5383 @EthanZimman Hmm
KaraSwisher--14 Mar--@evleaks Not sure the shades are going to work in this case

KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@KurtWagner8 Oh Kurt
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@MarlinRushing @profgalloway Hmm not sure
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--I. Cant. Even. As a parent (especially as my eldest son starts the college admission process), this is just sickening to imagine doing for your kid and thinking it is a good thing: https://t.co/VDmuDFrLoW https://t.co/G9WAbZMLzr
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@coolhandorg Come on
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@ricardodsanchez Ah really is dangerous talk. Sorry.

KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@maxiswho About right. Meaning well does not mean they are doing their jobs tho
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@Evollove19Mac @iw4nt2p14y @benshapiro I am not even slightly threatened by you clowns
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@Evollove19Mac @iw4nt2p14y @benshapiro Oh good lord get ahold of yourself  and grow up

KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@sunderks @Newspaperwalli @SantaClaraUniv @scucomm @cwclub Heh. I want it to sink in
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@LisaMcerlaneYao She do not
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@AaronIOlivo @benshapiro @SusanWojcicki Who said I was. As usual Ben hypes a fake controversy.
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@SantaClaraUniv Syntropy

KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@myerberlow Nice one! You have a plane right? ;)
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@aengland818 No
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@chhelenach @ewarren @AnandWrites That fb warren thing was not so suspect btw. A logo thing I think
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@mcmonaghan My thought too
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@scottm00re Hey @teddyschleifer
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@maxiswho Hi
KaraSwisher--13 Mar--@iw4nt2p14y @benshapiro Scared of him? As if.

KaraSwisher--12 Mar--This story is bonkers: A Silicon Valley investor is implicated in a college admissions scandal - Recode https://t.co/0fYnr1lUaZ
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@emncaity @Peggynoonannyc I just dont agree with a column. Its not too complex. Have your opinion too
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@Toffleresque @AOC Naw. His take on tech is arrived at in a dumb way.
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@Toffleresque @TuckerCarlson @cspan @BookTV It would be a traffic accident. Or a really awkward dinner party.
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@SethTHill @WIRED ;) @HeyHeyESJ will explore
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@JohnRHornbuckle Not sure this has not been going on forever. But he said what he said and fox will be the one to decide (they dont seem to care).
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@Toffleresque I asked! Now I think I will not engage with his fetid soul
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@SethTHill @WIRED Thx
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@joe_molinaro You never disliked something your kid is doing? Then you are either not a parent or an outlier. He does lots of stuff off the computer  and he gets free rein to explore all kinds of ideas. Good lord, you people cannot bear people not liking your crappy content is all.
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@lotamesh Read the transcript. That is just what I said. I did not ask her to ban that hot take hack. And not stopping my kids from listening either. But thx for the unwelcome lecture
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--Mostly death, but a certain SF raccoon made the list: Kara Swisher | 10 Things That Scare Me | WNYC Studios https://t.co/XusUcqpG7m
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@NuanceBro Pretty sure I dont run youtube
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@MarineRebb @benshapiro Thats unlike your gang I raised him to explore all kinds of stuff rather than not. Also go away
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--This is a cool story of being forgotten in the digital age by @nathanielpopper: https://t.co/8bKguO52ky via @NYTimes
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--Hey @PreetBharara now you need to come on my podcast! Congrats on book. https://t.co/njykXUgGdN
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@kathygriffin You are offcially in the Militia Etheridge
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@jayeskenazi @benshapiro @jordanbpeterson Hard pass
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@BAoki Mission accomplished
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@charitabee @benshapiro @SusanWojcicki But I dont run it, so it hardly matters. And I dont stop my son from exploring what he wants. So mind your own business so you wont be minding mine.
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@markyzaguirre Hence my snowflake tweet. Between her and Ben Shapiro, they really need to meditate or something.
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@willyzonda1 Well yes. The persecution complex is astonishing
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@Phillip_Kenyon Heh
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@bigotblog I did not say they should not show them. Look at the transcript. I also never stop my kids from listening
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@tmshrout Oh please you all never shut up
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@phuquocgf Prolly but not with advertisers
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@JohnRHornbuckle Hmm both conservative and liberal groups do this all the time
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@keithprivette Think it is on radio shows of some shock jock
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@livingrightco He def did not call any woman the c-word.
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@WL20090983 @kathygriffin Then we are all happy
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--Observation: there is no meltier snowflake than a conservative  whose work you say you dont like. https://t.co/gxMJDEJYbc
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@benshapiro @jordanbpeterson Ben, you are so good at being inaccurate. The recs go right there not him. He does not watch Jordan Peterson videos. He certainly can if he wants, but he prefers to play Red Dead Redemption 2.
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@ramaaysola Ha
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@sgolden600 No water. @Peggynoonannyc and I just disagree
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@billsorn Which I clearly and loudly apologized for. Many people were taken initially and few admitted it. I did, but you people are never satisfied because you live in a near constant state of rage
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@EngelKRichard Oh stop with the ignorant historical references. Its my observation that you all never shut up (me either)
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@Ammysnatcher @H_REBOT @RealFacelessMan @benshapiro @SusanWojcicki I dont like how any of the youtube recs work and how easily it gets to dank. So what?
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@RealFacelessMan @benshapiro @SusanWojcicki Peterson? Where did that dope enter the debate? I have a personal opinion that I would not have this dreck on a platform I run, but I let my kid watch it anyway and tell Susan not to ban it. So what? You people are never not enraged by whatever.
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@blm849 @TabathaSouthey @Peggynoonannyc Very
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@cslee990 @benshapiro @SusanWojcicki Again I did not say he liked Shapiros stuff. He watched it and is free to roam among all the viewpoints.
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@bodyXpolitic @benshapiro @SusanWojcicki Heh
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@Subchop1 @benshapiro @SusanWojcicki Fine under #lifetooshort
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@gonzatho000 @benshapiro @SusanWojcicki Yeah so what? I dont run youtube last time I checked.
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@dawgs4ever @benshapiro @SusanWojcicki I do not. He is very free to watch those videos. So step off
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@TurdFergusonUSA @benshapiro @SusanWojcicki Really?
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@JasonDoesTwitta @VanArtemus @benshapiro @SusanWojcicki It reveals I think he sucks. Personally. So what, I dont like a lot of stuff
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@VanArtemus @benshapiro @SusanWojcicki Exactly
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@geauxleafsgeaux @benshapiro @SusanWojcicki I did not say he LIKES Ben Shapiro. I believe he thinks he is a clown, but he is 13 and that is the last thing he said when I asked
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@benshapiro @SusanWojcicki It says I would personally but no, no to her question if I would have her do it, Ben. I was very clear when Susan and I talked about Alex Jones that I thought she should ban him for breaking the rules. But you know that.
KaraSwisher--12 Mar--@benshapiro @SusanWojcicki Lastly and sorry to report, but I said my son has watched your videos, not that he likes them necessarily. He also gives me some pretty tough feedback  he thinks my stroke column was too dramatic  so we have that in common.
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--@benshapiro Well neither of us runs the platform, so who cares what you or I think. But keep pressing an inaccurate line!
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--@benshapiro @SusanWojcicki I did ask why they did not ban Alex Jones in a different interview, which they then did later. Also in case you did not know: I do not run YouTube.
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--@benshapiro @SusanWojcicki I was also addressing how the recommendation goes dark quickly, which any parent would be concerned with. But again, when it is clear I said no, no, try to push the line that I was asking her to.
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--@benshapiro @SusanWojcicki I was saying that for me then obviously said no, no to her when she asked directly. But make hay out of it if you want since that is your specialty. And I obviously do not stop my kid from watching either. So stop the loud and inaccurate hand waving.
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--Why? Because they are not sorry: Why cant Fox apologize? It wont back down even amid Pirro, Carlson controversies https://t.co/lhhB2FcUlW
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--This will come as no shock to anyone. https://t.co/ZnIWPvXWxE
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--@WareLLC @kathygriffin Def in many ways though can you imagine if there was also social media tools
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--Is me with the dudes https://t.co/wkJeVxvI6G
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--@thesurfreport Thx
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--@MagicalRyan @profgalloway What can I do?
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--@jenitsy So says Ladypants
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--@petyagrady Girl, Fix that Structural Inequity!
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--If you want to see what a coordinated attack actually costs, I would suggest you watch this interview I just did with @kathygriffin. We jaw over this issue and more: https://t.co/nc1L9XMqeY
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--Also, like the Cultural Revolution? Last time I studied that, it involved quite a bit more punishment than being made into an obnoxious meme. https://t.co/qEtQFuutMw
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--Sorry @Peggynoonannyc, I utterly disagree this tired trope by a range of fainting columnists on Twitter mobs. Its different if it is organized bot attacks or calculated hits. But if youre in the arena and say/do something stupid, suck it up and deal if real peeps get irked. https://t.co/LtXS1oGq5z
KaraSwisher--11 Mar--Girl, not sure how I feel about those hey-lady titles. https://t.co/upXQVvB5PO

SundarPichai--21 Mar--Today's #googledoodle is the first ever to be powered by #GoogleAI! Pretty to fun to try out and see how AI and humans can be creative together:) More on the ML model that powers the #BachDoodle: https://t.co/1CC0iFuKiN https://t.co/d5c5ESSIwB
SundarPichai--19 Mar--This morning at #GDC2019 we unveiled @GoogleStadia: together with the game community of players, viewers and developers, we can create a new games experience powered by the best of Google and built for everyone https://t.co/RDsucuvIcM https://t.co/aRoCwwAkVg
SundarPichai--13 Mar--The new Lookout app helps blind or visually impaired people by verbally describing the words, objects, people, etc that are around them. Very proud to see our #googleAI work applied to help users in this way https://t.co/7Bjt4RvKip
SundarPichai--11 Mar--At I/O last year, gave an update on our #GoogleAI work in detecting diabetic retinopathy. Very encouraged by the continued progress in our efforts, particularly in India https://t.co/YjnZIs4wNa
SundarPichai--08 Mar--Earlier this week, we launched #Bolo in India: a reading tutor app powered by #GoogleAI text-to-speech &amp; speech recognition. Had the chance to visit some students today who are learning to read using Bolo, excited for all the great books theyll discover! https://t.co/HVwZe4SAMk https://t.co/H6vVYD8SNV
SundarPichai--08 Mar--In Mumbai today and happy to celebrate #IWD2019 with the India chapter of Women@Google at their I Am Remarkable event. Thank you for inspiring me with your stories about the experiences, challenges and triumphs of being women in tech. https://t.co/0W8eXVFk3c

ChristopherMims--30 Mar--@WalterStephanie @h4emtfr I was sad but as I pull back I'm excited to find new places to hang out online. And it's made me message friends way more, and start to shift twitter friends into messaging apps where our connection is deeper. Honestly on balance maybe it's better this way.
ChristopherMims--30 Mar--@WalterStephanie @h4emtfr Not just you for sure. And I just saw one of the nicest NPR hosts on the planet get trolled like this on Twitter, by someone who otherwise seems like a reasonable person? Something is happening to the social fabric of this site.
ChristopherMims--30 Mar--@guyraz @familyunequal Love your shows! This is a reasonable question given the framing of your your show.
ChristopherMims--30 Mar--@h4emtfr @WalterStephanie Yes to this whole thread. Still need to use Twitter to promote my own work (I guess?) but as of a couple of days ago am trying not to use it at all for anything else. Nuzzel is still somewhat useful.
ChristopherMims--30 Mar--To me the most interesting thing about autonomous drone delivery is that its a hell of a lot easier than autonomous cars. So the first time you get an autonomous delivery to your home, it could easily be a drone. https://t.co/B1fztkOJil
ChristopherMims--30 Mar--@UniqueIndvdual @CyrilCoste Thats changing
ChristopherMims--30 Mar--@jensmithWSJ that line is 100% @wjrothman :-)
ChristopherMims--30 Mar--Are you jonesing for coffee right now? What if you could use an app to order a drone to deliver it to you inside 4 minutes? That is happening. Now. Limited rollout in US later this year. https://t.co/B1fztkOJil
ChristopherMims--30 Mar--Here are some things I learned about drone delivery: 1. The barriers are regulatory, not technical 2. The unit economics are great 3. The NASA-developed system for managing them can handle up to 1 million in US airspace https://t.co/B1fztkOJil

ChristopherMims--28 Mar--I'm curious if anyone else shares this view: That it feels as if the pace of technological change has slowed. I don't think it has *actually* slowed, mind you, just that we're coming out the other side of an unbelievably rapid + personal change -- internet, mobile and the cloud.
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@LuxAlptraum huh. maybe this is next for me and my SO

ChristopherMims--28 Mar--San Francisco braces for 'earthquake' of new tech millionaires https://t.co/qbVHIeTf7B
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@sfwriter Thats interesting. I dont cold call people unless its to route a request  like a public information officer at a company or government agency. You are saying you get lots of cold calls from journalists?
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@lisafleisher @TechExecCrystal Don't forget that just opening the email can trigger tracking pixels that will get you more follow-ups, probably generated by an automated system programmed to "pop an email back up" in your inbox at intervals. It's literally journalists vs. spam bots.
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@russellbrandom honestly yes
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@TechExecCrystal not if it's an unsolicited cold pitch from a PR flack, of which I get several dozen a day I could answer every one with "no thank you" or I could do my job
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@lisamariemims say more?

ChristopherMims--28 Mar--If all journalists agree that cold calls to bring your attention to an email you are obviously ignoring is bad form &amp; will result in all future emails from that person being sent to the trash, that would extinguish the behavior right?
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--academics you say? https://t.co/isOqonACkb
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@mekosoff these three tweets are collectively a better essay than 90% of what's been posted in the past week
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@TravelingAnna recently bought a minivan and it triggered a memory of my dad doing the same (had completely forgotten it was ever in the sequence of family cars) and I was like "oh shiiii..."
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@kubakostecki @josephflaherty that's amazing. I guess Harry Potter works for a bunch of different reasons.
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@josephflaherty My 8 and 9 year olds grew up with Alexa and smart lights and iPads and phones and all that stuff and they *devoured* the harry potter series in good old fashioned paperback
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@ampressman @JasonAbbruzzese And is it also that a lot of that computing power has been pushed to the cloud?
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@palafo @JasonAbbruzzese Awesome. What do you like about it? What do you use it for?
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@Veronicatheblog lol
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@JasonAbbruzzese I mean tablets don't need to do much do they? And these were always over-specced, so they're still totally usable
ChristopherMims--28 Mar--@scott_bot the ~3-4 hours / week I let my kids play with theirs is such a powerful incentive that I can use it to bribe them to do practically anything

ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@ameseh never assail an -ism on twitter ;-)
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--Season 1 of this was very good! This stuff hurts all families &amp; it's not just about / for women in the workplace, it's truly for everyone. https://t.co/IJ5bRFNtI2
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@denisehearn_ right but everything seems to be pushing us away from this :( https://t.co/nxsIJRUws0
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@impcapital ok I believe you! Now how do we make it happen?
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@ejenk @schadenfraade sorry evan can't restart this cycle I have a job to do but basically I mischaracterized urbanists as people who want us all to move to dense cities when what I should have said is as someone who is pretty ignorant about urbanism my outsider's view that is it can seem like this
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@impcapital I agree but how would you export e.g. your entire Facebook network easily without it also being a massive potential security hole / privacy violation?
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@schadenfraade Thanks, and I get it, and you're right. I will take my lumps on this one and hopefully be a better thinker and person for it.
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--love 2 engage in discourse
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@stephenjudkins @michael_hendrix deleting it! I will now go flog myself for the considerable sin of a single ill considered thought which I then profusely walked back.
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@schadenfraade genuinely wish you had read the rest of that thread. It was a dumb tweet and I immediately walked it back. But I also reserve the right to be humand and occasionally be dumb (not deliberately)!
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@dylanmatt @venessawwong I do! The original tweet was dumb. Was thinking about it from a different frame that it did not reflect at all.
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@kfarr @schmangee Yes! As long as everyone tries to engage in good faith. Most here do, so we keep coming back...
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@mikepqr @humantransit actually https://t.co/BrsWddTszU
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@mattyglesias also wow, complete misrepresentation of my views, of which you are utterly ignorant. Totally agree that nimbyism is bad, but as usual you have a flair for alienating people based on fractional differences of opinion.
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@humantransit true. on the other hand the breadth of that beat is why I can talk about architecture at all. Not all of us have graduated to the valhalla of "write about literally anything you want to" yet...
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@VamonosLA totally
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@JamesSantelli @mattyglesias haha, fair
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@humantransit I mean if there's a tech angle, I can even cover it. I do architecture often, I have never found a tech angle on densification. It strikes me as being entirely an issue of zoning laws?
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@alon_levy @JamesSantelli @mattyglesias you're right about the last bit
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@MattZeitlin haha. Oy, maybe.
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--This is a good summary of how I was silly on urbanism &amp; I'm grateful to be on the receiving end of it. Would delete original tweet but that would only feed people who like to argue in bad faith. https://t.co/Bq1QIG3FGu
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@humantransit fair! I retreat from the field, grateful to have been schooled. Would delete the original tweet except at this point that would only feed the trolls.
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@JamesSantelli @mattyglesias Please. I use Twitter precisely for this reason. But clearly you can never make yourself a small enough target, and no amount of listening on here will satisfy people who are having a bad day &amp; looking for a place to direct it.
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@artologica @neurofim yes but I haven't tried it
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@IAmKrishanPatel honestly that is great to know!
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@mattyglesias This is a good reminder never to tweet about anything of interest to you
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--is it just me or is this an odd photo to offer to a national newspaper to describe the fact that you've broken up? https://t.co/APS187SnPk
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@michael_hendrix yeah this is probably a straw man after all. it's totally my outsider's impression of the field
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@humantransit this is twitter you want me to do *homework*??
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@swodinsky https://t.co/9kjW3pbekx
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@cheeflo well, racism and white flight
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@itstheannmarie many people lived in towns tho
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@tolles coming around to this
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@anya1anya sure but here we get into a fuzzy definition of cities those suburbs are often counted as part of cities, and rightly
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@venessawwong Yes, we *definitely* need to rezone them to eliminate mandatory single family housing &amp; there are cool models in some places in cali for letting people put accessory homes in their backyards
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@MichaelBabich right, or you've got to break the monopsonies, per @tolles
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@artologica @neurofim In the case of steel shelving, get a shelf tall enough to put your monitor at eye level on the very top, and then put one of the other shelves it comes with at exactly the right height for an external keyboard. voila!
ChristopherMims--27 Mar--@artologica @neurofim if you can install one in a wall I am using an Ikea shelf as a standing desk by far the simplest option is steel shelving of appropriate height (can be ordered for in store pickup in any lowe's or home depot or even delivered via Amazon)

ChristopherMims--26 Mar--Should say that I'm glad Apple is a company that, in some aspects at least, appears to live its CEO's values. And tons of research suggests consumers respond to that.
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@geoffreyfowler @dan_ness Sure. You don't think that Arcade does that? Or News+? Or the no-fee card?
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@GenePark @AdamJanofsky @geoffreyfowler @JoannaStern and @pierce of course
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@adamjh ah that too, but only occasionally
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--Yesterday's Apple event highlighted something that's been in progress a long time at Apple: Tim Cook's real stamp on the company. He has reshaped Apple's policies to align with his values. It's a way to differentiate from the rest of big tech. https://t.co/ofCnbr0SNW
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--Yesterday's Apple event was #woke as hell. And yeah, I mean that in the over-wrought, bordering on disingenuous sense of that hashtag. https://t.co/ofCnbr0SNW
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@chrisdancy @Coneee depends on incentives inside those publications
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@CEbikeme lol
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@EntStrategyGuy @geoffreyfowler that is generally how things work in mature markets!! :)
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@geoffreyfowler It's really interesting the huge divergence between journalists and everyday people in my mentions in opinion on yesterday's Apple event. Sometimes feels like tech reviewer opinion on Apple is increasingly a contra-indicator of its future performance.
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@geoffreyfowler Apple's market power -- and the power of defaults -- are tremendous. Just being able to put all these services in front of people, and get them to sign up for free and then half of them forget they ever signed up -- is huge.
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--With respect for @geoffreyfowler who is my third favorite tech reviewer in the world, I think all the cynicism about Apple's launches yesterday -- like the cynicism about its Watch at launch -- will look silly in a few years https://t.co/3oo6pHxCSt
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@geoffreyfowler wow OK, reading
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@olifranklin @Coneee this is not the whole of these publishers' content!
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@shafithinks the idea at least here is it pays for content that otherwise wouldn't get paid for. it's in addition to
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@Coneee it's a subset of the content
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@jpschust Few people do that
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@joshsternberg Whats old is new again. Paywalls are back and this time they work!
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--Still, its an interesting and timely experiment given that paid newsletters, patreon, tightened paywalls etc. have consumers conditioned to pay for quality once more.
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--Maybe Apple and all its partners will in the end prove to have bet wrong. Maybe the economics are so shoddy for publications it doesnt work out.
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--Apple News+ is a bet that people still like to browse. That you *can* judge a publication by its cover. That if you signal and provide quality people will pay; that serendipity is still one of the best ways to find ideas and news.
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--No way to tell if consumers will adopt but heres the core genius of Apple News+, if it works: the bundle. I like a lot of these magazines, not enough to subscribe to any individually because Im already so busy. But put them all to gether a la Netflix? Yes, please. https://t.co/IENQzEGhOL
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@AlexJamesFitz Nat geo looks great on here tho
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@lalasoo news about apple
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@chrishuntwalker Say more... ?
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--So, who wrote the serious essay warning that Apple News+ could just be the next The Daily or pivot to video or whatever?
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--To get Apple News+ you have to update all of iOS wth
ChristopherMims--26 Mar--@lizzieohreally omg she is so good
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@LeeRatliff I'm pretty old Lee
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@amandakhurley adding you to my enemies list

ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@LuxAlptraum I meant your notion. but now I'm not sure at what level of irony we're engaging... so, uh, carry on
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--milestone in getting over the need to be liked: people I dislike now clearly dislike me as well

ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@cremnob say more?
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@mikejcasey Thanks mike!
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@cheeflo They're already squeezing drivers in a way that's quickly becoming ugly. @TheRideshareGuy recently said turnover at Uber is like 70% a year!
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--Apple Card is kind of underwhelming at present, yeah? But the fact that Apple will now have a payment platform of its own, with all the possible upgrades and incentives they could add to that, is itself interesting.
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--Just occurred to me that if Lyft and Uber can't make money until we get self driving cars uhhhh a lot is riding on self driving cars
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@EricPaulDennis in the case of Lyft, could very well be: magical thinking
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@DonaldRichard @jkwade @iankar_ dm me your number

ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@maxrogo @Gartenberg @robpegoraro @WSJ @JoannaStern ty!
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@DonaldRichard @jkwade @iankar_ best take is in my text messages unfortunately 
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--*eventually
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--Apple could just turn all its ad space into ads for its Goldman Sachs credit cards and probably justify 100% of its spend on content just off the back of that
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@caseyjohnston @samfbiddle ugh now I'm seeing the uncomfortable parallels
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@anildash @caseyjohnston haha. Oh you two. I admire your gimlet-eyed cynicism! Because history suggests you are probably right.
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@caseyjohnston fair point, but publishers like my own employer came to this (I would think) from a position of relative strength (I have zero knowledge from the inside and no one consults me on anything)
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--twitter users who don't know the terms of the deal or even what content is going to be available on Apple's news app: publishers r so dumb for getting into bed with apple!!
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@meganmorrone sounds like an invitation to a wicked laceration
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@cxy that's when you'll know they're serious

ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@SimiStern @ShannonVallor ok but what's the ROI on that
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--when future historians chronicle the origins of the gospel of Jobs they will no doubt reference the "first temple" in Cupertion https://t.co/w67zLQwv5O
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@hassankhan for me yes
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@ERICSOLEM sometimes
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@reckless @jyarow So what you're saying is, streaming could be this much-touted thing that just turns out to be kind of a nice-to-have that makes them a lot of money but nothing compared to what they make on iPhone?
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@Wrighteous I didn't mean to sound churlish, I honestly consider all of these to be cumulatively worth the price of entry.
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@CatherineShu haha. This is so great. Hope it wasn't too dramatic.
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@ShannonVallor I worry a small child is going to try to climb into one of these
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@darth @jyarow ha. Dark Sky will give you an umbrella warning if you set it to.
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@gaunetes It does but I run in the woods and I just want to hear the trees and the water and commune with the world spirit etc.
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@StephLauren I've noticed this. Makes total sense in that context.
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@ruchowdh It's such a crock. The research I've read says activity tracking only works if it's linked to enforceable goals. (Like your employer or health insurer is pushing you.) That said it has helped me leave my phone behind when running and that gets me a great deal of joy on its own.
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@jyarow I want a really detailed weather breakdown and for that I need my phone to display all the stuff I want to see. I'm not a golfer but I am a huge weather nerd, so...
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@jyarow I do check time that's true weather and emails? hell no. last thing I need is this little attention hog to buzz more often
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@thejenlife haha ty amazon what is your dog's insta?
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@HoldenthePage @pierce I mean if it's not going to be your laptop replacement, yes
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--My primary use cases for Apple Watch, in order of utility+frequency 1. Finding my iPhone 2. Skipping ads on podcasts while I drive 3. Knowing when I've hit the midpoint of a run 4. Occasionally reading a text 5. Pretty much nothing else

ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@cremnob new ways to consume news seems like the OPPOSITE of surprise and delight tbh
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@davezatz not helping Dave

ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@LuxAlptraum that sounds gross! japan did itself a disservice by moving away from squat toilets imho
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@TaylorLorenz @taylrn whoa, first name. Congrats!
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@pegobry dude's far from perfect but, yes
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@LuxAlptraum this reminds me of an odd detail from WWI -- when the british requisitioned a brand new battleship that was about to be delivered to Turkey, aside from ripping out all the Ottoman decor they had to change all the toilets from in-floor models
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@Carnage4Life What's a better framing then?
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@jeffshelly Cathy's work is amazing and I'm in awe of her abilities. What's more amazing is to realize how many other people on that thread could have written a comparable book from a different and equally valuable perspective.
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--Actually I spoke too soon. Three more amazing threads that spun off of one branch of the weekend's discussion of algorithmic bias. https://t.co/x4cUKETZ5A https://t.co/rbU0tz64Nl https://t.co/doTpHRyceX
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@rkarmani @chadloder @Grady_Booch @safiyanoble @iajunwa @ruchowdh @jovialjoy lyft :)
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--I think it's worth giving the last word on algorithmic bias to @zeynep who squeezed a chapter's worth of thinking about this into this thread, which I think could be hard to interpret if you're not steeped in the terminology, but if you are... https://t.co/7nBYOubNKF
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--So the amazing (to me, as someone who is primarily a tech reporter and only lately a legal or policy one) is the sheer volume, complexity and thoughtfulness of the laws we have governing algorithmic / institutional bias -- and its applicability https://t.co/jj7tJ1KThE
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--The thing that struck me in reporting on algorithmic bias is that it predates ML by a long shot. Jimmy Vacca, NYC council member who wrote the first algo bias law in the country to pass, was thinking about this when police wouldn't disclose their algorithms to him in *the 1980s*
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--And @lizthegrey thinks even phrasing algorithmic bias in terms of its technicalities is harmful. https://t.co/BUeE5NL67U
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--Who is responsible when algorithms are biased? This is a central question. They are often about avoiding responsibility for bad, harmful or even illegal decisions https://t.co/50HkjOMypJ
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--Then @susanthesquark had a very strong negative reaction to the piece. The thread underneath is worth reading. Shows the importance of the words we use and their definitions in statistics / mathematics vs. common palance / social science https://t.co/XT8ARW7g0m
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--First up, @stevesi pointed out something that I think is true and always worth keeping in mind: Fear of AI is as much fear of every other kind of unacountable faceless institution that's ever existed https://t.co/qFkwU4JFde
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--And I think it's worth highlighting what some extremely smart, knowledgeable people said about algorithmic bias in my mentions, so a brief thread highlighting some responses.
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--So possibly nothing I've ever written has ever generated more (almost entirely good-faith) discussion on Twitter than this https://t.co/4Vjx5aGyo6
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@sivavaid beardinal?
ChristopherMims--25 Mar--@deanabb @psb_dc @WSJ @DeepLearn007 @SpirosMargaris @terence_mills @ahier @pierrepinna @andi_staub @jblefevre60 @KMcDSAP @data_nerd @ChrisGGarrod This is true in some cases, but not in others. Academic studies of the Compas sentencing algorithm, for example, found that there was no mathematical way for the algorithm to yield exactly the same outcome for different racial groups, because of different incidences of crime.
ChristopherMims--24 Mar--@mariachong Whats the latest you read about?
ChristopherMims--24 Mar--Good discussion here on algorithmic bias https://t.co/U7FWgNInCk
ChristopherMims--24 Mar--@iajunwa @chadloder @safiyanoble @ruchowdh @jovialjoy Yes, please!
ChristopherMims--23 Mar--@chadloder Chad, serious question, did you read the piece, or are you just responding to what you feel is the framing of the tweet? As for interesting and fruitful topics not being discussed, absolutely. Some of those I simply didn't have space to get into, but I'd like to hear about more!
ChristopherMims--23 Mar--@iamwhoisme Not really
ChristopherMims--23 Mar--@JustTheFacts37 Indeed, affirmative action is a straightforward recognition of and consensus correction of algorithmic bias
ChristopherMims--23 Mar--@blm849 yeah that's true. I think when Cathy was talking to me about "algorithms" she meant the sort we were discussing at the time -- the sort that decide what sentences people shold get, who gets insurance at what rate, etc.
ChristopherMims--23 Mar--@ProfJeffJarviss this is why I'm hoping it gets leaked to Axios first
ChristopherMims--23 Mar--@katienotopoulos the hot duck is neither hot nor a duck
ChristopherMims--23 Mar--@susanthesquark Discrimination here merely means deciding between two outcomes. And if you disagree that algorithms always have a bias  one we choose  Id love to see you debate it with an algorithmic auditor like @mathbabedotorg
ChristopherMims--23 Mar--@blm849 Here I mean simply that they choose between outcomes. That is the definition of discrimination. It sounds like what you are arguing is they are not inherently prejudiced
ChristopherMims--23 Mar--@blm849 Certain useful ones are
ChristopherMims--23 Mar--@stevesi @erikbryn Exactly. Which is why the algorithmic accountability laws and bills I chronicle in this piece  some never or rarely reported on  are so important.
ChristopherMims--23 Mar--@erikbryn Correct. At least machines are consistent and potentially transparent. They can be better than us if we hold them accountable.
ChristopherMims--23 Mar--Eliminating all bias from our software isnt possible. Deciding which biases it should have is. Now comes the hard part: deciding on what basis we, as a society, want to discriminate between outcomes that affect the lives of millions. https://t.co/4Vjx5aGyo6
ChristopherMims--23 Mar--Trying to eliminate bias from software reveals an uncomfortable truth: algorithms are inherently discriminating, so the question is what bias do you want it to have?  https://t.co/4Vjx5aGyo6 https://t.co/ft34CqEggs

ChristopherMims--20 Mar--@kaitlinugolik true. But it's something to talk to your doctor, partner, support network about *before* because it can be seriously debilitating and dangerous. Right support for it does wonders tho! And forewarned is forearmed so you're leagues ahead of where I was (men can get it too)

ChristopherMims--20 Mar--Between all the original content on Hulu, Amazon and Netflix, it's hard to get excited about *even more* coming from Apple. I know I am not in the mainstream on this. I know that the average American is a bottomless maw for television and will gladly hoover it all up.

ChristopherMims--20 Mar--Listening to Other Minds, there's a bit about how conscious experience is what happens when we encounter novelty and are forced to model it on the central stage in our minds. If you link that process to our reward circuitry, could see how curiosity is hard-wired into us.

ChristopherMims--19 Mar--By 2065 seniors will represent 1/4 of the population, projects the U.S. census bureau. Can't help but wonder how that will intersect with / affect our adaptation to what will be by then quite common extreme weather events.
ChristopherMims--19 Mar--@JoshuaTMcCabe what's the title of that one?
ChristopherMims--19 Mar--@JoannaStern @JGDphoenixrises @WSJ I bet it was low tech. She left her phone out or something... he screenshotted and texted himself...
ChristopherMims--19 Mar--This is a good thread. The larger theme of current narratives that led to Christchurch is that we've seen this all before -- it's what led to the eugenics movement in the U.S., and nazism. Important to dig this rot out at the root. https://t.co/jfB9tK3qCR

ChristopherMims--18 Mar--@geoffreyfowler @meganmorrone I mean my kids' ipads were bought used, so... they are not new or nice
ChristopherMims--18 Mar--@meganmorrone @geoffreyfowler My kids like games on iPad so much I find it a little bit frightening. I am pretty strict about limiting their time on it. OTOH being in the same Roblox world together brings them so much joy, and they are interacting with *each other* in-world and IRL, shouting, laughing. So...
ChristopherMims--18 Mar--@swodinsky I feel you. Will new jobs be accessible to these displaced workers? Are these warehouse jobs are really sustainable? They seem so physically demanding even when automated. And disruption of these kinds of jobs is pretty much always bad for workers in near term
ChristopherMims--18 Mar--@emilybell in other words he just said "businesses will pay for business-essential information" might as well cite Bloomberg Terminals and the WSJ... tho that wouldn't illustrate the point he's trying to make (which I don't think is valid...)
ChristopherMims--18 Mar--@geoffreyfowler kids love it for games of course
ChristopherMims--18 Mar--@ezyjules Yes. And this is one of the things hedge funds and private equity do to so many vulnerable businesses / industries, unfortunately.
ChristopherMims--18 Mar--@swodinsky I read the whole thing and... why is it gross? Competing with dollar stores and Walmart, poor people need goods delivered too...

Can you imagine employers letting employees sit for as long as a trial requires? Not to mention the whole idea of sitting for your "peers"

ChristopherMims--15 Mar--Not going to be tweeting about the shooting today. I respect those who will, and those doing important journalism on it. But for the rest of us, I must conclude that spreading the shooter's message of hate is what he'd most want. Strategic silence is a weapon.

ChristopherMims--14 Mar--really deep fact checking is agony. just absolute torture. scraping past layers of inference and shades of meaning to the bare scrith of truth is hard, dirty work.
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@anthonybrown @AdamSinger this is adorable but please don't post pictures of your kids publicly! It's for his safety. 
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@buttermilk1 Good. A testament to your parenting!
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@buttermilk1 sending you strength
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@postdiscipline haters to the left
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@blakeleyhpayne @SerebroRaya I feel like we're close to turning this thread into a dedicated slack
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@CharlesFLehman all I'm saying is that if he wins I have halloween costumes locked in for the next 4 years, easy
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@mviser ty for the tech angle on Beto
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@olifranklin wow Oli calling CPS
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@blakeleyhpayne @SerebroRaya christ maybe I'm out of my depth after all
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@CharlesFLehman as a man who has been both let me tell you it's not as hard as you think
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@DonaldRichard Logan, yes... but Avengers: Infinity Wars??
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@2sp00k thank you, you have made my day
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--popularity of avengers group ensemble films proves we are broken as a species
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@blakeleyhpayne @SerebroRaya I should amend this by saying that it's the Avengers group ensemble films that are terrible, captain marvel, black panther and Guardians of the Galaxy are all excellent
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@RVT9 dril twitter
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@SerebroRaya alright chris let's dance
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@audreygelman @jasongay it makes me so happy
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--still thinking about this A+ tweet https://t.co/Bxr345QUCI
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@mr_james_c insta still hasn't figured me out because I like recipes and dogs and babies. c'mon insta, dudes like those too.
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@jasongay @audreygelman contrast with https://t.co/6zb2RuQktN
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@mr_james_c really curious what gets advertised to a cantankerous pro-markets euro-right (USA left) middle-aged london-dwelling bobo?
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@dcseifert another way of saying that is one taps into absolutely primal themes common to our deepest myths and our most essential nature while the other is about a bunch of special effects masquerading as a plot
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@lisamariemims yes and so many bad takes on him already
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@steff_blehh that's bad. but the good news is more felons can vote in this election, if that's what you're talking about
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@ryanbeckwith @ParkerMolloy YES but the people doing good work don't talk about it on twitter
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@dcseifert to be fair to your inner geek these two things are not the same
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@hyperplanes I'm going to have to find so many tech angles aren't I?
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--we've only just begun the long march toward the 2020 election and I'm already tired
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@eric_hontz cool! what's the discussion?
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@PaulRoales lol
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--heres a thought, if youre a professional commentator who missed the rise of trump maybe youre not qualified to coment on the electability of dem primary candidates

ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@micsolana @rabois uhhh can I hear more about the city in africa?
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@jecoombes big of you
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@DaleyAFC it me
ChristopherMims--14 Mar--@AlexJamesFitz c'mere
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--Mobility between income quintiles in the U.S. has been flat for decades. So at least the situation isn't getting worse? That wealth is inter-generationally transmitted is just how it's been in the U.S. basically forever
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--Our economy is full of well-paid but basically b.s. jobs for which an elite degree is practically a prerequisite. It's a form of personal branding. Or signalling as economists call it. Even with fraud, it's an honest signal: I know how to navigate a world of wealth and privilege.
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@taralach lol you had me there, was going to sic the wsj parenting crew on you to send our best advice / life hacks :)
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@taralach omg you're having a baby??
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@taralach daycare? play date? pediatrician?
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@mr_james_c just swaddle it
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@alexhern @olifranklin come stay in my attic!
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@frankrebecca wow I am exceptionally bad at metric conversions
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@CharlesFLehman actual lol
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--Port-a-baby is also available to transport small dogs and most any cat
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--Here's my idea: Port-a-baby. It's drones that transport your baby (under 3 kilos)
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--ugh no https://t.co/yxlNiIvTue
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@alexhern @olifranklin maybe time to get on a plane?
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@ahawntweets yea please do... I'm fascinated by this subject
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--ok but who is the Lyft of graft? https://t.co/YS0gxS77La
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@LesleyKroupa @SlowMoney ty!
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--Fiat Chrysler to recall 863,000 vehicles because of failed emissions tests. Maybe just stop making vehicles with emissions...
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@ChanSteele see, those are great. also learning to pan-fry tofu was big for me. I'm really not into most meat substitutes but still eat eggs... which are infinite in their malleability. Roasting is awesome in the winter here but I can already tell I'm gonna hate it come the warm season!
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@rabois Keith please say more (I feel like the acid test for this is drone delivery and hyperloop, no?)
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@jasongay @nytimes I do love their recipes where's our recipes?
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@jc4p I think maybe I'll finally make one of those
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@hunterwalk basically yes. time to log off now :)
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@gaberivera @danprimack @Techmeme anonymous crypto exchanges been down all week
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@ChanSteele II finally started stir-frying in a wok and cooking rice in a rice cooker and that's been transformational. Can reduce any amount of chopped vegetables to a meal in 20 minutes. Have also heard Instapot Daal is shockingly fast and easy.
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@jasonlk oh I'm glad to hear. Personally I like reading about the swimming pools. Guessing from her breed she's more about the lawns.
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@rags easier to do it as a family I imagine!
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--remember when Twitter was just "I had a ham sandwich for lunch" and thirsty selfies where's that on the internet anymore
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--this thread is (salt bae kissing his fingers like a chef) https://t.co/ES7n0Vghkz
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@jasonlk fantastic, now upgrade his reading material please ;)
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--if helicopter parenting is hovering over your kids at every moment, is drone parenting outsourcing the raising and monitoring of our children to automated systems?
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@mr_james_c @cyantist lol
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@gaberivera @danprimack tip @Techmeme
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@ctseto anyone with a retirement fund really
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--late to this but I'm trying to eat fewer animals and it's much easier than eating 0 animals but still feels like the right thing to do realpolitik and incrementalism ftw
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--It's a terrible irony that most retail investors have been shut out of the early stages of high growth startups and yet there are hypothetically many smallish, medium-growth companies that could probably use the money of investors who have more patience.
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--Hypothesis: Current VC funding model is a poor match for the highest-value problems left for tech to solve, because all of those problems require changing mindsets and regulations, which simply takes too long
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@ahawntweets Interesting! I bet theres research on this. I heard on techmeme ride home there are hundreds of influencer marketing firms out there already
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@JoannaStern we should all get a soundcloud tho
ChristopherMims--13 Mar--@lobna_gouda @pierce E-ink tablets are coming
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@ahawntweets same. now I'm wondering if those comments are viewed by the people making them as a form of support + encouragement. Like, they like that influencer, they don't pay for her content, but this is how they "tip" her, knowing it means more advertisers for her?
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@LeahFessler sold, ty!
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@sriramk straight out of the Google interview playbook
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--I can see why marketers and fans like influencers so much. How can you not find content like this totally authentic and relatable? Those 2,088 likes and hundreds of adoring comments don't lie!! https://t.co/hJo1bEbnC3
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@ahawntweets &amp; to your second question, you're totally right, we all have some social capital, hence nanoinfluencers, fake "influencers", teen influencers...
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@ahawntweets to your first question clearly this stuff works or advertisers wouldn't use it, so it's conceivable it's here to stay ... otoh because it's so fungible I could picture it suddenly becoming uncool / unworkable if audiences suddenly decide it's just not OK... right?
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@tomaxwell problem: solved
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@laura_nelson your finest work
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@AdamSinger @nw3 Sorry to "actually" everyone on this thread but the future is actually artificial wombs that remove the burden of childbearing from women's bodies and free them to use sex cells from whomever they like, including other women, through egg fusion.
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--I feel like between this college scandal and those Fyre festival docs influencers are going to get a bad name
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--"Neither participated in crew; both are influencers."
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@robinhanson @AdamSinger mmm no sorry you've misread me then
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@AdamSinger I'm sure you're right about online dating. It is just very very bad. The entire model is broken.
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@AdamSinger which is too bad because there's a lot of interesting research on this! tl;dr for his conclusions is that dating apps are weird and distorted marketplaces in which information salient to women simply isn't available!
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@waltmossberg @JoannaStern Thanks for the clarity Walt. I'm starting to feel like even if this isn't true now, there's a risk it will be true in the future and the consequences could be significant even if the risk is low. Final calculus: time to delete!
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@AdamSinger this feels like a protracted meditation on why one person, the author, can't seem to get a date
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@LeahFessler say more?
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--this story just keeps on giving https://t.co/WFFqGLOFTK
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@laurencegellert lol
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--I don't have a soundcloud but everyone should watch this video about not putting pictures of kids on the internet ever, by my very talented colleague @JoannaStern 
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@rishmishra how is that going?
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--who among us https://t.co/1Jar6vTKeu
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@katienotopoulos 
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@JoannaStern @waltmossberg Im seriously considering deleting every single image of my kids that exists on Instagram, even though it is a protected account. Am I paranoid, or is that a good idea? I have almost entirely stopped sharing images of them
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@JoannaStern @waltmossberg All of my social media accounts are private, and I even wiped my Facebook account recently so there is no deep history there. Is that enough? Should I do more?
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@brianrahmer Oy. Yes
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@johnpavlus I would like that. I would call it rover. And program it to say "I ruv ruu"
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@JenBoynton @ranjanxroy I mean, this at least is pretty typical! as is the bribery, apparently?? 
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@Charlesknight ahhh. glad you checked tho. would hate to say it if it weren't true!
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@cardiobrief @ddiamond lol
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@ranjanxroy holy frijoles
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@RMac18 or random VC or...
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--clearly the solution to corruption in college admissions is code school for everyone
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@ranjanxroy definitely one of those times I wish twitter afforded more characters
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@Charlesknight the teen vogue one says sponsored story? I can't find it on the page if so...
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--definitely the most "in these times in America" story of 2019 (so far) https://t.co/jY8R5Ro1Id

ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@MJ_Coren @markrhill I think the point is they are putting more money into high risk to make up for shortfalls
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--Probably the most important piece of journalism @JoannaStern has ever done. If you are a parent or are ever snapping pictures of kids, you should watch this video and seriously consider her recommendations.
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@BryFitz you know who needs their own spinoff film? this robot.
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--Making robots gender neutral is fine but I think the ultimate way to get us to respect them is to make them good at sassing back https://t.co/07gUqA8jZn
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--Time to rethink our habit of barking orders at robots coded as women? Virtual assistants go gender-neutral
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@NelsonMRosario it's tuesday :)
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@oliviasolon Great piece; well done
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--We spent decades splashing our face across the internet and now it's been used to train facial recognition algorithms which could be among the most powerful tools of oppression and state control ever created and it's too late to take any of it back. https://t.co/ofja3ygp3t
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@hakosam which direction tho? I mean they're low now...
ChristopherMims--12 Mar--@iiiitsandrea yes for sure

ChristopherMims--11 Mar--To officers in the German navy who were surprised in 1914 by England's entry into WWI, "it was absolutely incredible that Englishmen could ever become the Allies of so degenerate a race as the French."Robert K. Massie, "Castles of Steel"
ChristopherMims--11 Mar--I get the desire to ban billionaires and break up big tech but people know what hedge funds are and how their owners behave, right?

ChristopherMims--11 Mar--@mr_james_c no I  mean, this is a really real thing
ChristopherMims--11 Mar--@mquirion @bcmerchant Matt I'm like you but when I researched the topic of self serve vs. high touch customer service I discovered tons of people want to be greeted. for older people, daily contact with service workers can be only human contact So we can't generalize from ourselves...
ChristopherMims--11 Mar--@eaton I mean you also just described the history of all short-term adaptation, this is just how life works
ChristopherMims--11 Mar--@mr_james_c we can also control the haze -- put sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere. much cheaper option. probably harder to control tho...
ChristopherMims--11 Mar--I mean agricultural employment is 2% of the U.S. workforce when it was once 2/3 ... pretty sure if Walmart can eliminate 90% of its employees at a net cost savings it will https://t.co/LOEFphub9n
ChristopherMims--11 Mar--It is BANANAS that the U.S. lost its ability to send humans to space and now we're going to regain it due to, among others, SpaceX, a private company. https://t.co/PB4dE3ToVo
ChristopherMims--11 Mar--@eaton disagree. what's more futuristic than being like "fuck it, we own this crisis and it's all up to us now?"
ChristopherMims--11 Mar--@calebwatney Also we should do this. Because, forget mars, Venus turns out to be WAY more habitable.
ChristopherMims--11 Mar--There will definitely be a point in the next 100 years when our atmosphere is so unbelievably and obviously effed that we will try everything. Geoengineering and climate catastrophe should be as common a conversational topic as whatever POTUS is up to.
ChristopherMims--11 Mar--All geoengineering options are bad, some are less bad. I'm team "put sunglasses for the earth at the L1 Lagrange point" but it's also the most expensive option.
ChristopherMims--11 Mar--@calebwatney how about a sunshade at Earth's lagrange point to prevent the destruction of our own atmosphere?
ChristopherMims--11 Mar--@hassankhan if I got any more basic I'd be liquid plumr

ChristopherMims--11 Mar--@jason_kint right, not pegging to POTUS, just that moment in time
ChristopherMims--11 Mar--Here's an Axios poll suggesting the proportion of people who have a favorable view of Facebook is down 28 points in the past year alone. Even Amazon suffered a 13 point drop.
ChristopherMims--11 Mar--Favorability for big tech companies has plunged in past 2 years. When Trump was first elected, a Republican operative told me tech was the one thing with bipartisan support. Today you have big tech getting pilloried at CPAC, threatened with breakup by Dem presidential candidate

ChristopherMims--10 Mar--@gchaslot Less reach but also less time. For me its mostly about boosting others.
ChristopherMims--10 Mar--@jmgrygiel That part is challenging. It turns out most people are bad at twitter
ChristopherMims--10 Mar--@stefanvonimhof would retweet this but its 10 years out of date
ChristopherMims--09 Mar--@tinycarebot thanks, tiny care bot! I will
ChristopherMims--09 Mar--@_steve3_ it's like chill mode for twitter
ChristopherMims--09 Mar--Yesterday I did an experiment where I retweeted instead of tweeting and it was bliss. Here's a trick: If you feel the need to tweet an article, just search Twitter for that link and retweet someone else's take.
ChristopherMims--09 Mar--@TedWrightMedia bit late to this discussion aren't we
ChristopherMims--08 Mar--@ForsythJenn @WSJ @mrothfeld @joe_palazzolo in awe of y'all, honestly

ChristopherMims--08 Mar--out of respect for #IWD I'm going to stop tweeting for the rest of the day (what would Twitter be like with only women?)
ChristopherMims--08 Mar--I thought yesterdays's takes that said "Zuckerberg's proposal to integrate all of Facebook's messaging apps is also about making the company proof against being broken up" and thought them silly, but joke's on me https://t.co/F75zOqneGO
ChristopherMims--08 Mar--@TimFernholz jelly
ChristopherMims--08 Mar--Hard not to read America's sordid history with slavery and racial discrimination and not conclude that at the very least this country should radically reshape how we fund k-12 education.
ChristopherMims--08 Mar--"Reparations are a drastic policy and hard to execute, but the very act of talking about and designing them heals a wound and opens a new story."

ChristopherMims--07 Mar--Facebook is used by everyone. So lets not whitewash the fact that its defaults are how the service works for the most users. Whatever it decides to take, it will for the most part get. Privacy settings are for the minority of us who understand what Facebook is really tracking.
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--Talking with a relative who deals with the public a lot they note that their general experience with the average Joe or Jane is they have no idea about Facebooks privacy settings. Its all hanging out there accessible even to people who arent their friends; public posts.

ChristopherMims--07 Mar--at the end of the year "oven mitts" could hand out a prize for whoever had the absolute worst take of the year, sort of like an Ig Nobel prize
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--a newsletter I would read every day would be called "oven mitts" and would consist solely of the hottest (i.e. worst) takes of that day
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--stuff like this is in my experience a universal feature of all big bureaucracies, which have significant trouble understanding the value of their highest performing workers https://t.co/UIIC4JRnfp
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@AdamSinger 100%. always the case
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@katienotopoulos @kevinroose I mean it doesn't even have to suck (tho I'm sorry if it does!) I think you also outlined an eloquent defense of all of us taking "mindless" breaks when we need them, contra the religion of workism
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--I remember when @katienotopoulos critiqued @kevinroose's piece about ditching your phone by pointing out that for some of us in some contexts it's a totally legit and healthy escape and it made me think long and hard about how tech "addiction" is hardly universal. Truly, ymmv.
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--Deleting social media apps off phones (if you feel they are hijacking your time) is a great thing to do for lent or just, you know, a month. https://t.co/tRJqdTrK2N
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@laura_nelson GOOOD. Did this years ago. Step 2 is don't let yourself look at it on the web on your phone either. Helps a lot.
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@OneBandwagonFan Hi Harold I hope you have an awesome weekend with your kid(s) who are lucky to have you!
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@joshsternberg @antoniogm @AlexJamesFitz please say hi to your wife for me she sounds like exactly the partner you need
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@KateAronoff "Everything, it turns out, affects everything." https://t.co/V6P2RSnDIw
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--shout out to all my dads on dad twitter
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@joshsternberg @antoniogm @AlexJamesFitz just goes to show you never really know what a marriage is like on the inside
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@antoniogm just wait until Twitter is reading itself to you
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@ryanmiddleton @askpang oh wow
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@lizzieohreally but you know they'd all tune in
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@AdamSinger @mcwm same
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@mekosoff honestly your twitter feed should be a paid newsletter, don't let jack be the only one to profit from amazingness like this :)
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@wgrosso lulz
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--u know who doesn't have a brand? Nike. just real talkin'
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--(when CEOs get testy about their competition, that's when shorts should get greedy)
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--this reminds me of when Blockbuster's CEO in 2008 said Netflix "wasn't even on the radar screen in terms of competition"
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@swodinsky at least we're not venezuela!
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@BradyDale I bet you could. I sometimes think that LTE Apple Watch + Nokia flip phone would be optimal
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@swodinsky to be a journalist in the shadiest industry of them all... bliss!
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@cebsilver @yoda Curtis Man who shouts at clouds
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@cebsilver this would be good tho, make it easier to filter them out of your inbox + life
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@NeelBhula has a nice ring to it
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@AdamSinger @TaylorLorenz muh life
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@yrechtman sure thing. honestly just use pocket on a mobile device and set it to always download new articles and read them there. I have the same problem as you do and am about to try an android-based e-ink tablet explicitly to solve it
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--What if we just went back to the tradition of using people's professions as their surnames? Bob PR Flack, Annie marketing director, etc.
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@davezatz @JoannaStern I think it makes sense if you reflect that everyone at Apple is distracted by the parts of the biz that actually make money and they believe are the future
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@samfbiddle @alexhern bingo
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@alexhern he didn't say he's going to kill ad biz or the news feed or any of that tho
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@davezatz @JoannaStern Joanna likes to make fun of my Chromebook but it has a *great* keyboard :) also fwiw I'm such a keyboard snob I often combine it with an external one I like even better, even when I'm on the go
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@holly @DenAutomation @SodaSaysTweet @Native_Union @Cygnett @smartechworld @proporta is that an avocado-shaped battery pack?
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@TimAeppel sorry Tim it's the law
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@Chevon I mean in all honesty would be a good piece of service journalism
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@kaitlinugolik what an enabler. History will not be kind to her or these policies.
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@JoannaStern it's weird to think keyboards are now the key differentiator in laptops
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@AlexJamesFitz snap
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@Chevon smart. How many people have current ones?
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--Welp now I guess he has to change his name to Tim Apple
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@JoannaStern lost cause. apple hasn't made a good laptop in years. Cook Just wants you on iPad Pro + keyboard
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@kaitlinugolik oh gross. Missed that. Unbelievable. Child abuse and neglect has permanent impacts as damaging or worse than physical insult. Should be a crime.
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@Chevon new feature on The Cut: "what's in your bug-out bag?"
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--waiting for behavioral economists to build this into their model https://t.co/yD7vjXBRzH
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@kaitlinugolik childhood ptsd is real and pernicious
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--politics used to be about pitching a big enough tent to encompass all your constituents; now it's about who you're willing to alienate
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@JoannaStern you should be in product
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--these days everyone's a prepper, the question is what kind
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@yrechtman pocket android app on a chromebook
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@mcwm 
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--@jenvalentino thought it would add gravitas
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--he said "WhatsApp" 14 times
ChristopherMims--07 Mar--I turned Mark Z's latest into a word cloud you're welcome https://t.co/A0rKqYm4KL
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@seyitaylor Yesss
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@prufrock451 @CNN Wild
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@trekonomics my 9 year old is already right on the border
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@nathanpboston @OrganicTransit sadly no
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@jessiwrites TOTALLY
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@OrganicTransit lol... :)
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@kdamica good point
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@twitthinker I'd kill for one a month!
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@trekonomics take a zillion trips with my kids
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@levynews @sal19 ok but... "The exodus hasnt shown up in Facebooks earnings, which continue to grow rapidly." 
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@kelseymsutton would be something oddly hilarious about a gallery of images of one of them in 10 different settings looking exactly the same tho
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--I feel like Zuckerberg's missives would be more credible if he posted them to Medium
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@mquirion fascinating
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@OrganicTransit doubt you'll be anywhere near me (baltimore)
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@aneel whoa, interesting. ty for the reference
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@JustinList you're lucky
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@etherbrian mine too honestly
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@OrganicTransit fascinating - where are they used?
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@hyperplanes right
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--In other words if you *can* work more and make yourself more valuable in what feels like an increasingly polarized economy, you have a runaway effect where everyone is just running to stand still in the status race.
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--Interesting that professionals (especially men) are the ones working more than ever and who have sacrificed the most leisure time. Can't help but think this is linked to growing healthcare costs + the knowledge that being uninsured is the surest route to bankruptcy.
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--We have deified work while casting ourselves into the pits of guilt over our failure to do it more. Which is nuts.
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--Late to this but @DKThomp's piece describing the American religion of "Workism" is powerful and transformative and should be required reading in high schools and colleges and, heck, boardrooms and slack channels everywhere.
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@insideNiMA @foamspace riiiigiht so, not  doable at all ;)
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@ShortFormErnie @TaylorLorenz this is why dave's solution on insta is so beautiful: just mute everyone maybe that's what you should do on twitter?
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@TaylorLorenz no one actually cares anymore I swear! just unfollow everyone and rebuild from zero, it's easier
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@lisamariemims Too bad I guess
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@insideNiMA @foamspace So you mean just charging to take a pic in front of a place? 
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--Instagrammers deplatformed from reality https://t.co/OaU3zlsgyW
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@mdc unrelated but lol at your new bio
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@mcwm ratio'd
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@JakeSwearingen you're too nice, you should just do it if only to remind everyone to be less thirsty
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@davegershgorn please just switch to an anime avatar and be done
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@DonaldRichard @nikillinit ughhhh I don't wanna get old :(
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@JakeSwearingen should be an autoresponder
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@oneunderscore__ ty I'll be here all week
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@DonaldRichard @nikillinit so what y'all are saying is that Instagram is the next medium to get taken over by boomers...
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@pegobry @LeahFessler seems fair considering you get to live in france
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--Instagram isn't the next Facebook, it's something different and ultimately as big or bigger
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--hypothesis: any platform that can be taken over by credulous nonsense will eventually capture a valuable demo (boomers with spare cash) but drive away young people. Meanwhile, visual mediums like Insta and TikTok will never go down this route precisely because they're so visual
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@LeahFessler I always set aside 20% and the only reason that was enough was I was always making poverty wages...
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@sandcastler1 then why doesn't apple have this problem
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@TravelingAnna @BasseyE @PaulRoales I mean if Facebook still needs all these humans... and they have some of the best AI people in the biz
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@eliotwb @finneyeric this is possibly your best tweet ever
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@dcseifert why stop there, you could turn the entire experience into a manic, madcap performance leaving them dazed and ready to leave their field forever
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--anyway I blame @CaseyNewton https://t.co/anucwpxLRB
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@MClendaniel right and the side of my desk is a chimney protruding from the floor
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@mikebush I bet he didn't last here tho
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@fxshaw did they live
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--Since 2017 Facebook lost an estimated 15 million users in the U.S. alone, most in the coveted 12-34 year old demographic https://t.co/f3wuM0b3Kg
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--has anyone in the 4 billion year history of life on earth ever said yes to a "deskside"
ChristopherMims--06 Mar--@anshublog this sounds reasonable but I know nothing about this stuff, really, just starting to learn

DavidHeinemeierHansson--28 Mar--This is what qualifies as "smart money". The complete disregard for human health and happiness in the quest for exponential growth.

DavidHeinemeierHansson--27 Mar--Apple isn't Xerox. And clearly there are many people who care deeply about the product there.

DavidHeinemeierHansson--27 Mar--While we're going over the crimes of Apple's computer choices lately, check this out: The new $1099 iMacs include a 5400rpm hard drive. Holy shit. That's ballsy. Shipping cripplingly slow hard drives in a $1099 machine is wow. https://t.co/xYxkVJhE0V

DavidHeinemeierHansson--27 Mar--The main way I've avoided the frustration of Apple's MacBook keyboard debacle is by using an iMac. Using a keyboard that's almost identical to that 2015 MBP version. It's great. But should we really have to run and hide from these laptops? Shambles. https://t.co/CFNW66Fngh

DavidHeinemeierHansson--27 Mar--@MikkelBondeDK I have latest gen. Problem is not fixed.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--27 Mar--@kvlly I have that exact problem too. Along with a bunch of other keys acting shitty.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--27 Mar--@otac0n Apple's only saving grace is that I'd rather use their laptops with shitty keyboards running OSX than use another brand with a good keyboard running Windows.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--27 Mar--Apple is underestimating the huge pain in the fucking ass it is to deal with Apple support. It's so painful that plenty of people would rather live with a shitty keyboard than dealing with the hassle of repairs, going without a computer, etc. This is Danger Zone territory.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--27 Mar--It's possible, though, that Apple truly does not know the extent of the problem. They seem to be basing their assessment purely on "contacted apple about the problem". My keyboard is fucked, didn't contact Apple. Had another laptop that was fucked, didn't contact Apple.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--27 Mar--The ongoing saga with the faulty MacBook keyboards is bananas. I have the latest MacBook Pro. I haven't used it that much. The keyboard is fcked. Is this an elaborate scheme to get people to use iPads? Just to get a working mobile keyboard? https://t.co/SskXCWyJiZ

DavidHeinemeierHansson--26 Mar--@RMDStudio_Ca I don't dispute that, but stoicism is a cure for such folly. Not encouragement of it.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--26 Mar--@codenakama A Guide to the Good Life, Meditations by Aurelius, On The Shortness of Life by Seneca 
DavidHeinemeierHansson--26 Mar--@AniketSMK It's nonsense either way. There's no stoic virtue of suffering. Discomfort is at best a technique to reach that which is virtues: A resilient mind.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--26 Mar--@RMDStudio_Ca But you're not going to find any of that in the stoic teachings. Half the lessons are about embracing the shortness of life, that it's long enough if you live it well, and to welcome death when it's due!
DavidHeinemeierHansson--26 Mar--I'd challenge anyone to read, say, The Manual by Epictetus, a former slave, and hardly the elite figure, like Aurelius, and not walk away with profound insights and techniques for coping with the human existence. https://t.co/ciFRyWI79e
DavidHeinemeierHansson--26 Mar--Preparing your mind for adversity is part of basic mental fitness. We will all face despair, heartbreak, disillusion, anger, and a wide variety of other troubles whether we're rich or poor. This just means we're all human!
DavidHeinemeierHansson--26 Mar--I get the attraction of "haha, look at these Silicon Valley fools  who should have it so good  subjecting themselves to cold showers or fasting", but to reduce the wisdom and psychological insights of stoicism to "elites preserving their power" is reductio ad absurdum.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--26 Mar--"But tenets of Stoicism  which can be interpreted to argue that the world and its current power structure are correctly set as they are  fit right in", that's a really sad and cynical conclusion on stoicism. https://t.co/fTw1N12fi9

DavidHeinemeierHansson--26 Mar--@rakeshlobster I have faith in Apple writing and enforcing utterly draconian partnership agreements that even Goldman wouldn't tempt flaunting.

DavidHeinemeierHansson--24 Mar--@derSchepp @firt If the security of your app hinges on someone not reverse engineering your front-end code, you dont have a secure app. The web was built on viewable source, and Im proud to support that transition at Basecamp and via Rails.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--24 Mar--@HTAaron2 And there are 47m people in Spain, 65m in the UK, and 500m in the EU. All with examples of healthcare systems that work better than the morass of the US.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--24 Mar--@karesti Southern Spain, Marbella. We had two kids in Spain. Very pleased with all the care we got over 10 years there.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--24 Mar--@pheras Very pleased. Are they perfect? Of course not. But people dont go without care because theyre poor, arent forced into medical bankruptcies, and the care is in many ways better when unencumbered by insurance companies (and lawsuits).
DavidHeinemeierHansson--24 Mar--Big change is scary, but the status quo is dystopian. Fiddling around the edges of a profoundly broken system is the incarnation of political decay. Americans spend twice the slice of GDP on healthcare as does the average OECD country.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--24 Mar--Additionally, Ive used three different healthcare systems extensively: The Danish, the Spanish, and the American. The latter is by FAR AND AWAY the most bureaucratic! The most forms, the most indecipherable policies, the most uncertainty around cost and coverage.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--24 Mar--When the #1 concern in a report on Medicare for All is whatll happen to the workers of and investors in insurance companies, you know its time to burn it all down. Seriously fucked up framing. https://t.co/ASHoINvhht
DavidHeinemeierHansson--22 Mar--Popular health apps are selling users' medical data to advertisers, telecoms, and credit reporting agencies, new report finds. The industry is completely out of control. May the regulation that's hopefully on the way be swift and draconian.

DavidHeinemeierHansson--20 Mar--@jspoker Bizarre comparison. Tesla is calling their system AUTOPILOT. There's nothing automatic or pilot about a system that'll kill you unless you are as mindful of the road as if you had not assistance.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--20 Mar--Also, I'd like my self-driving software to be written by programmers who aren't working 80+ hour weeks in fear that they'll be terminated by their boss if they don't.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--20 Mar--You're risking your life if you take your eyes or hands off the road when driving a Tesla with autopilot. And Elon's promises of just how close they are to letting drivers be "fully asleep while the car drives to the destination" is grossly irresponsible marketing nonsense.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--20 Mar--Watch how an update to Tesla's autopilot software changed the behavior on one driver's common route from "isn't this cool!" to "omg I almost died". Talk about high criticality software updates. https://t.co/mZLqLEsMlW

DavidHeinemeierHansson--18 Mar--@NvrLift_MJR @dhhracing @IMSA No, just do the obvious job. Nobody in the paddock is confused as to whether Pumpelly is a professional driver or an amateur.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--17 Mar--@achalaugustine @imachainsaw If ten percentage-points is the difference between starting a business for you and not, it says more about you than it does the tax code.

DavidHeinemeierHansson--17 Mar--@achalaugustine @imachainsaw Top marginal rate is 60% in Sweden. In California its 50.5% (state + federal). Hardly a world of difference.

DavidHeinemeierHansson--16 Mar--@PotatoDepaulo Unpopular with people who struggle with sarcasm 
DavidHeinemeierHansson--16 Mar--@stephanhov Say it or dont say it. But if you do say it, own it as your own, without a bullshit unpopular opinion cover.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--16 Mar--@snellingio Soon, I hope!
DavidHeinemeierHansson--16 Mar--Unpopular opinion: Any opinion interesting enough to make a compelling tweet is unpopular with someone. Yet that label is only applied when the writer fears the wrath of their in-group. Ditch the label and the assumption that every utterance needs to be an in-group belly rub.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--16 Mar--@denisdaigle @basecamp We decided we wouldnt . We had done consulting for years. Fine business but we were happy to become a product company.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--16 Mar--Love how odes to performative exhaustion always seem to sneak their way into these kinds of top lists. Dont go the extra mile, just get to your fucking destination, then take a rest, and stop bragging about how far you went. https://t.co/booSnlsBDe
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--@hrstoyanov Take your racist doomsday nonsense somewhere else.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--Besides, I didnt actually realize just how far the depths of despair reaches in American society until after Id been living there for years, and was settled with ties. The contrast of living long-term in different societies is the real kicker.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--Disturbingly common counter to any criticism of American society is: But you chose to move here, so it must be pretty great?!  A) People chose to move for all sorts of reasons beyond best country in the world on all objective metrics. B) Im rich, thus personally shielded.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--@thechiefunicorn Per CBS report, looks like they get 49k DKK per student who passes exams in a student year, or ~$7.4k. So ~$22k for a bachelor's degree. Clearly quite a variance depending on how you calculate it. https://t.co/JAeKtuRuns
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--@thechiefunicorn DK 2018 budget for higher education: https://t.co/Op1xDvl9e6. Numbers on students enrolled in higher education: https://t.co/DT7QDHdyXZ
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--@thechiefunicorn Although, if you just look at core cost, the DK 2018 budget assigns 25 billion DKK to run higher education. There are 160,000 students enrolled. That's ~15K DKK/$2.3K per student per year (or ~$7.5k avg for 3-yr bachelor). I'm sure there are some other costs too, but ballpark.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--@thechiefunicorn Looking at just whats being asked of foreign students not eligible for state funding, rates do look higher. Starting at 18k for a bachelors degree in economics, and 30k at CBS. My mistake, but still almost an order of magnitude less. https://t.co/AivODq0Uu1
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--@AddictiveColors No. Hiring someone off a set of grades and a brand-name diploma is just not something we do at Basecamp. I dont care where you learned what you learned. I care about who you are and what you can do.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--@berkes Cc @AdamStoddard
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--@thechiefunicorn Someone else quoted another study pinning DK undergrad degree at $8-16k, all in.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--@thechiefunicorn And that CBS figure was from 2011, though I doubt its changed much.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--@thechiefunicorn CBS figure of 9500 for an undergrad degree. Mentioned on Wikipedia. And recalling seeing a study to the same effect. But Im sure you could calculate it many different ways, given its not a direct market expense.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--@LeadMuscle Only when its being run like one. Much of the rest of the world manages to run college as an essential function of educating the populace. And they succeed.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--@bennytheshap That money isnt just set on fire. Its spent on administration, facilities, and everything else that goes into the 4-year luxury retreat. Danes just dont have those expectations of their educational environment, and thus cost-per-student is minuscule in comparison.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--@TURDSTOMPER The only thing that might be worse than sliced bread is definitely sliced cheese 
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--Easy to dismiss as easy for you to say, and while not an unfair response, it misses the larger picture: When youre already set, trading your autonomy, dignity, and place in world history for, say, the role of someone who armed Zuckerberg with powerful new weapons? Mistake. https://t.co/QQRVBFc1Et
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--Apples business model aligning so well with a defense of privacy in the majority of cases* is maybe my favorite thing about the company.**
DavidHeinemeierHansson--15 Mar--Celebrating something for being the best thing since sliced bread really only works with people whove arent accustomed to good bread. The kind that grows stiff when its cut and doesnt last for months on end. Sliced bread is The Worst.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--@MattBGilliland @DiscoverPraxis @LambdaSchool @treehouse @bryan_caplan Theyre a symptom of a failed state approach to education. Doesnt mean theyre not valuable, just that its dystopian that theyre needed.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--Theres no way a welfare state like Denmark could afford to sponsor $200,000-per-student educations. So they dont! They just focus on giving students a great education at 1/20th the price AND IT WORKS! People get fine educations &amp; anxious aristocrats dont need to bribe anyone.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--Reason why American college degree quickly runs into the hundreds of thousands  while Denmark spends just $10k per degree for most  is that its often a 4-year luxury vacation at a campus the envy of Cesars place, with an education throw in as a cherry.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--@amatta_12 @CaioBnchi Nonsense. I moved to the US because I joined a company that was based there and because I wanted to try it.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--@pierre_foucart @djaiss Think youre confusing remote work with either the gig economy or outsourcing. Not a proponent of either. Remote work is about unshackling employees from commuting and the office and a prescribed city. Huge boosts to human flourish.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--@CalinLeafshade But the great thing about the Danish system is that they arent so fucking paranoid to recoup that they decry emigrants the opportunity to spread around the world. Most dont. It works out.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--@CalinLeafshade I did when I lived and worked there. At rates of around 50%. Which, given my well-paying tech job prior to entering university, more than covered the expense of that degree.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--@antoniogarcia78 Government run, government funded, government pays students a stipend while they study.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--Which of course is the conclusion of anyone who actually examines the data. Google used to be Stanford snobs until they ran the data. Conclusion: brand-name degree is not correlated with higher performance! https://t.co/quj4T5g1xx
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--So. Maybe at least a portion of the (justified) outrage over this college admissions scandal could be directed at the root cause: The caste system based on brand-name degrees perpetuated by American businesses.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--And of course, I didnt actually pay that $10k as a student. The Danish state paid ME to attend university. Which meant that attending university without well-to-do parents or a crushing debt burden was possible. Basic societal investment in the education of the populace.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--Thats not $10k per year. Thats $10k TOTAL for an undergrad degree at Copenhagen Business School. This assumption that a quality education must be six figures to be worth it is utterly insane. Its a debt trap that reinforces the same caste system.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--And you know what? My education was FINE. Introduction to all the basics of business administration and computer science. All the tools needed to run a software company for ~two decades thats made 100s of millions in revenues. Cost to the Danish state? $10k per undergrad!
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--I graduated from Copenhagen Business School. My application was simply my high-school diploma and C+ grade point average. No fucking laundry list of extracurriculars, athletic trophies, or any of the other bullshit the American application process makes students dance for.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--Tech companies are notorious for their Ivy preferences. Stanford, MIT, Berkeley. Im sure you can get a nice education there but gtfo about it being some singular mark of virtue. Evaluate candidates on merits related to the work. Not credentials, not Ivy markers.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Mar--Lets no forget why this college admission scandal is a thing: Because so many American companies use a diploma from a brand-name university as a caste sorting system. This isnt about education, its about gate-keeping the aristocrats.

I don't think there's any reason an American congress needs to be so inept. There's a fresh class showing us how it could be instead.

DavidHeinemeierHansson--05 Mar--The United States of America is in enough of a sorry condition as it is. Teachers begging for basic necessities on donors choose, unfunded liabilities out the wazoo, cuts upon cuts in fundamental services. Pitting munis against each other for tax incentives is repugnant.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--05 Mar--The opposition to crony capitalism isn't whether the gangster shaking you down leaves you with $20 or $10. IT'S THAT THEY'RE SHAKING YOU DOWN PERIOD! Per-company incentive deals are only sometimes financially bankrupt, but they're ALWAYS morally bankrupt.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--05 Mar--The defense of crony-capitalist incentive deals usually hinge on "if we get to keep anything, the deal is worth it" logic. So why stop at $3b in incentives for Amazon against proclaimed $30b in economic growth? Just give them $29.999b back!
DavidHeinemeierHansson--05 Mar--@Feefyou How about we don't give any fucking corporates a special blank space in the tax code where they can just write in what they'd wish to be true?

BenedictEvans--30 Mar--@mrisher @boblord @runasand (Great explainer. Can you post this somewhere permanent/linkable please?)
BenedictEvans--30 Mar--@roybahat @joshelman @AvidanRoss @mobahat Roy bot, you say? https://t.co/hTYLMMPWSQ
BenedictEvans--30 Mar--@bkrudy Would you measure Netflix's share of streaming, or of TV? Would you measure Amazon's share of online, or of retail?
BenedictEvans--30 Mar--@steven_odb Lots of parts of Amazon are printing money.
BenedictEvans--30 Mar--@RJMcGirr That's not what people who say it mean to convey.
BenedictEvans--30 Mar--Talking about Amazons share of ecommerce is meaningless. Its like talking about Netflixs share of streaming TV or Teslas share of electric cars. The market is retail. It wont get 100% (any more than Walmart did), but there is NOTHING people wont buy online in some way.
BenedictEvans--30 Mar--Note to the FT graphics team: the chart on the right is a textbook example of bad dataviz. The numbers show a 52% share. Does the image convey this? https://t.co/BAHsosQu7z
BenedictEvans--30 Mar--@ianbremmer @joshuamarch The USA catching up with the rest of the developed world, as usual ;)

BenedictEvans--30 Mar--@jcjohnson @ahawkinson Marketing. Bury bad news on Friday. I cant see any basis for saying it changes what the AirPods are.
BenedictEvans--30 Mar--@jcjohnson @ahawkinson The value of the AirPods does not depend on whether one of the many wireless chargers on the market comes from Apple.
BenedictEvans--30 Mar--@rorysutherland Thats not st pancras
BenedictEvans--30 Mar--@ahawkinson @jcjohnson It has wired charging.
BenedictEvans--30 Mar--@jcjohnson @ahawkinson They didnt. The new AirPod case has a lightning port and Qi charging, exactly the same as the iPhone X and Xs. You can charge with USB or any wireless charger.
BenedictEvans--30 Mar--@HariDhanagopal Openess is irrelevant. Price delivered by the ecosystem is what matters.
BenedictEvans--30 Mar--@eladgil @annimaniac @lyft @shanaglick @Pinterest Doesnt fit the narrative.

BenedictEvans--28 Mar--Scenario: a cute dog at the beach Google Photos: take a photo. In a month, search dog at beach is useful. But if I show Google Lens the same image, telling me dog at beach is not useful. I might want the breed. Same image, different intent.
BenedictEvans--28 Mar--@ScottMagdalein @MadelineAshby Do you know that you get the healthcare even if you have never paid a penny in taxes? That no-one in any developed country outside the USA has ever been given a bill for healthcare that they cant pay?

BenedictEvans--28 Mar--@frontofstore Exactly
BenedictEvans--28 Mar--@MayaPlentz @fdestin The usual stat is that around half of VC investments lose money and ~5% generate 2/3 of the returns. Average VC-backed founder is just under 40 years old. . These deals are risky because anything going from 0-$1bn in 5-10 years is risky and non-obvious. Thats the point.
BenedictEvans--28 Mar--@graiz Has the HomePod not worked?
BenedictEvans--28 Mar--Exactly. Presenting is an introverts networking. https://t.co/UjWE2z2Oon
BenedictEvans--28 Mar--@416ash @stevesi Every tech press review.
BenedictEvans--28 Mar--@bergmayer @mims yes and no.
BenedictEvans--28 Mar--The iPhone is technically a cut-down PC (full macOS!), but we think of it as a better phone. So, we judged it against featurephones, not against PCs. And we judge the Chromebook as a browser, but judge the iPad against a Mac Pro.  All about framing.
BenedictEvans--28 Mar--On this vein Ive been thinking about discussion of Chromebook versus the iPad. No-one got the idea that Chromebooks *should* run arbitrary code or have a user accessible file system, so no-one is frustrated with the choices made in the product
BenedictEvans--28 Mar--Posit: AirPods, unlike the Apple Watch or iPad, get (mostly) complete acceptance from tech world because although its entirely powered by software, no-one things of it as a computer and no-one expects to be able to compile code on it.
BenedictEvans--28 Mar--@mbaram @tomstandage @voyage Weather is just one of many engineering challenges. Its not a gotcha!

BenedictEvans--27 Mar--@Joi (I think calling all of these AI ethics creates a certain amount of confusion)
BenedictEvans--27 Mar--@Joi There are several parts to this. Theres the false correlation, and theres the correct correlation we dont want to use - in both cases with the operator not knowing its happening. But also theres bad people knowingly using a correlation.
BenedictEvans--27 Mar--Someone should make a smartphone game around spotting influencers having their photos taken in popular spots around major cities.

BenedictEvans--27 Mar--@raygirn @sethbannon The comprehensive intellectual defeat of central planning does, at a high level, point to how bad an idea it is to decide what other people should work on. 
BenedictEvans--27 Mar--(The answer of course is yes, more or less. Every new wave of automation poses questions, some justifiable, some not, and some just panicked)
BenedictEvans--27 Mar--Posit: we do not need any more threads or medium posts trying to argue about the fact that different kinds of businesses have different capital needs and funding models, only one of which is venture. 
BenedictEvans--27 Mar--@sethbannon Alternatively: anything that people want to buy matters, and anything that someone wants to spend 5+ years of their life building matters.
BenedictEvans--27 Mar--I dont understand. Elon says AI is an existential threat to humanity. https://t.co/qd1h0PNYo2
BenedictEvans--27 Mar--Was there a wave of think tanks and newspapers doing SQL ethics pieces in the late 1970s?
BenedictEvans--27 Mar--@DexterTalbert Apple never normally reassures anything, and it never normally says we will do something without saying what. It didnt say we will do a credit card but wait 6 months to find out what
BenedictEvans--27 Mar--@DexterTalbert Were doing something but we wont tell you anything about it is not how you talk to investors
BenedictEvans--27 Mar--@nitinalabur No
BenedictEvans--27 Mar--@Romestantc @youngElPaso @VictorJServin That is a tech question. Be sensible.
BenedictEvans--27 Mar--@JPedde Maybe you could call it... cable TV
BenedictEvans--27 Mar--@MiklosPhilips Apple is  paying TV people to make more TV . Even if you ignore the general  consensus that TV quality today is fantastic, Apple isnt changing it.
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@Romestantc @youngElPaso @VictorJServin There should be more TV shows is not an Apple problem.

BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@mims Whats your dogs Instagram?
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@karmonyk You dont need your own content to put a video player in AR.
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--I dont understand the idea that Apples vagueness around TV yesterday was about Wall Street. Yes, investors wonder how and how far Apple will grow. But they know it is working on TV. Yesterday added nothing to that knowledge.
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@Wildreamz You do have to execute. 
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@MiklosPhilips That is not a problem and Apple is not offering a solution.
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@seuncr8vwox I wrote this blog post. In 2017 ;)
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@HS_512 It solved the SMA needs upgrading problem.
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@Adam_Lacy How does their own TV give them leverage with Netflix?
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@kb_india_bglr Subscription music is a big deal. But Apple didnt buy music rights.
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--Apple tries to bring a unique attitude and a unique set of capabilities to problems. It tries to find them and solve them in a different way. What, apart from money, does it bring to TV commissioning?
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--The iTunes Store solved a user problem. So did the App Store. And so did Spotify and Apple Music, and indeed Apple News. But what user problem is solved by Apples commissioning TV shows?
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--Apple should have a deal where you pay one price and get all the TV channels there are, in one UI. And maybe lay dedicated cabling to your home to deliver it, with a box you plug into your TV. I bet lots of people would pay $100 or even $200 a month or so for packages like that.

BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@DStallibrass @CaronBW @CompetitionProf Netflix will spend $13bn on content this year. It seems counter-factual to look for Apple monopoly powers here.
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@realkniels @sknthla Claiming you have a working product and revenue when you dont is pretty binary, though. Thats not the same as a manual back office
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@mikesilva Nothing was said that would let an investor assess the TV service
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@mikesilva Nothing in the TV segment was aimed at investors
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@kayvz @wgnyc Exactly
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@sjurgis @pandom_ It does. Install the google keyboard
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@Wildreamz No, thats easy.
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--@realkniels @sknthla Except thats not the mantra in SV and the whole company was done in the opposite of SV practice at every level.
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--Also: Apple (and others) are now so big that things that look non-core or non-strategic or about the user experience, not the revenue can still be a very big absolute dollar number.
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--But also hard not to think that the industries here - magazines and TV - were once so much bigger than tech, and now theyre essentially marketing tools for business with other things at front of mind.
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--Every time I look at Netflix i feel that I dont really know what the questions are - theyre all TV questions. Something of the same here.
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--Puzzle of the day: why Apple decided it should have a big event around TV when it isnt ready to say anything specific. Very uncharacteristic. Who was the audience? The people on stage? In LA?
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--TIL: people worried how long it would take to empty all 500 ashtrays on a 747. Someone suggested a central vacuum tube system to collect the ash.
BenedictEvans--26 Mar--Pessimism https://t.co/OX19rNpicj
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--@WMassag What is Netflixs content budget? What is Apples?
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--Some Apple News+ Magazines are just really badly compressed JPEGs of the pages. Is that going to change?
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--@juberti @robleathern Not on my phone
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--@dmrollinson What intent?
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--So far Apple has told us nothing of consequence about its original TV except that it exists.
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--@sriramk Actually, I would have tried that on Steve.
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--Please god make it stop.
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--Programming budget, motherfucker. Do you have it? https://t.co/G4YddIixTE
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--I dont want to know which famous people Apple has signed up. I want to know if the annual budget is $1bn or $10bn. Getting audience for a TV platform is like orbital mechanics- the only way to go up is to burn more fuel.
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--@chr1sa @jamesbmeigs @texture Director!

BenedictEvans--25 Mar--Wondering if Apple Arcarde is about trying to promote games that wont be on Android. And fits into the mindfulness/family friendly brand stuff
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--Apple card: retention.
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--@johnolilly Retention.
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--Orange had a voice assistant and a banking license in 1999.
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--Every publisher wants a direct relationship with its readers. It doesnt follow that they should all expect to be able to get it.
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--(Wondering if Adobe is in the room)
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--Workflow, tools, integrations - how much more time you dont have does Apple News + need? Whats the file format?
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--I hope Apple did a really deep dive into the general failure of iPad magazine apps, especially the ones that wanted to reinvent the magazine. Most titles dont have the resources or people to lay out a whole new version and make lots of funky new animations.

BenedictEvans--25 Mar--@dpfrank07 @StephenNellis Exactly
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--Is this a significant new pillar for Apples business, or is it just an accessory to make you slightly more likely to replace your iPhone with another iPhone? That is, it is revenue or self-funded marketing? 2/2
BenedictEvans--25 Mar--I think there are three levels of question to Apple TV: How is the execution? How compelling is the product?  Does this have any relevance outside the US (now a small % of Apple revenue). But...1/2

BenedictEvans--21 Mar--@Austen Im a huge fan of unbundling education. I just dont understand the all universities are worthless jihadis.
BenedictEvans--21 Mar--@suyashganu @amasad @Austen I never spoke to a grad student outside the bar in 3 years at one of the best universities on earth. 
BenedictEvans--21 Mar--@SamuelKnoche Yes, reading a book is *exactly* the same as spending years being taught by experts in the field.
BenedictEvans--21 Mar--@amasad @Austen Yes, the negative impact of being taught by experts in your field... wait, what?!
BenedictEvans--21 Mar--@Austen No, that is a different argument. What baffles me are: people who claim that if you spend 3-4 years being taught by some of the best minds on earth you get nothing from it except a certificate. And people do say that. Lots of them.
BenedictEvans--21 Mar--@EVplusEV @chr1sa @pt That is certainly not an accurate description of the UK system, nor the French. Its pretty common for UK academics in the US to say the quality of analysis from US students is a long way behind people at an equivalent stage in in the UK system.

BenedictEvans--21 Mar--Now Apple is having another go. Theres an old theology joke that the Jewish problem is you wait for millennia  for the messiah but he never comes, and the Christian problem is he came and nothing changed. I wonder which it is?
BenedictEvans--21 Mar--The tech industry always used to talk about getting into the living room and onto the TV, but it turned out the way to take over the living room was the smartphone. That makes everything else (AppleTV, Chromecast, Hulu etc etc ) something of an anti-climax.
BenedictEvans--21 Mar--I wonder what Apple will do next week, how much its a strategic move versus a marketing/retention hook, how much it changes TV rather than just being one more option, and whether it will have any relevant at ALL outside the USA (no longer even Apples largest market)

We have vast computing power at both ends and are working out what goes where.  (See also FB end-to-end crypto and its implications for ads, safety)
BenedictEvans--19 Mar--@xtan Hence my point: your theory needs to account for why this is different.
BenedictEvans--19 Mar--@xtan It is far to common to just assume that because you have a website something fundamental has changed. White-label brands are not new. Data is not new. Loyalty programs are not new.
BenedictEvans--19 Mar--Any analysis of Amazons role in retail needs to remain coherent if you search &amp; replace Amazon with Walmart, Safeway or Sears
BenedictEvans--19 Mar--@KalebMcKelvey Do you know what percentage of transponder capacity is used by  DirectTV?
BenedictEvans--19 Mar--@joshlockie Theres a link in the thread. It was an F106
BenedictEvans--19 Mar--@abevoelker DirectTV spends a lot of time on satellite contracts. Does that make it a tech company too?
BenedictEvans--19 Mar--@abevoelker This is as useful a metric as asking what percentage of transponder capacity DirectTV uses, or how many lines of code are in a BMW.
BenedictEvans--19 Mar--@ChiefScientist @NetflixOSS Have you seen Sky Plus?
BenedictEvans--19 Mar--@rafikmatta Thats not a good taxonomy. Uber is a tech company. So is AirBnb.
BenedictEvans--19 Mar--Netflix is a tech company the way Sky is a tech company. That is, it isnt.
BenedictEvans--18 Mar--Occurs to me that the new Apple office is totally alien to the normal model for Silicon Valley offices and real-estate development, in almost exactly the same way that Apple makes things differently to traditional consumer electronics companies.

BenedictEvans--18 Mar--A Montana sheriff called the nearest airbase to report he had come upon a fighter that was on the ground, pilotless, and still running. Even the radar scope was still operating. He asked how to turn off the engine. Someone at the base told him to just let it run out of fuel. https://t.co/umy6jiwsID
BenedictEvans--18 Mar--As the fighter neared the ground, it stayed level and made what is described as an approach for a perfect landing in a snowy field, sans landing gear...
BenedictEvans--18 Mar--At which point it recovered and headed off straight and level toward the horizon. Perhaps it was the change in balance, or the change in aerodynamics. Whatever it was, the wingman radioed, "Gary, you better get back in it!"
BenedictEvans--18 Mar--"The fighter went into a flat spin at 35,000 feet. The pilot  rode the aircraft down to 15,000 feet, all the while trying spin recovery procedures without success, and then ejected."
BenedictEvans--18 Mar--@elkmovie there are always reasons.

BenedictEvans--18 Mar--@bgurley Alternative view: some US startups solve problems that dont really exist elsewhere, or are solved in old ways that work well enough that theres not a big opportunity.  The backwardness of the US incumbents creates openings. (See also ride-share)
BenedictEvans--18 Mar--If machine learning means that you can answer questions with the aggregate of data instead of the aggregate inferred from user behavior, might having billions of users actually become less of a moat?
BenedictEvans--18 Mar--@chrismessina That is not at all how Rome worked. Persia yes, but not Rome.
BenedictEvans--18 Mar--@Sharkyl @KennyStoltz They have much more competitive telecoms industries, with prices at least half what Americans pay for mobile and highly competitive  broadband markets where the US mostly has monopoly or duopoly. They regulated those markets rather than doing a breakup that achieved nothing.

BenedictEvans--17 Mar--@Petercampbell1 @jimwaterson @scottygb You certainly could make that point seriously - if you dont have a linear schedule you have to work all that stuff out again. How many episodes, what narrative arc, etc. the hooks are different. A bit like writing pop for streaming instead of radio.
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--@qhardy Huge difference in US in UK model, and a flaw in the rounded individual philosophy
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--@iam_preethi Spend 5 years as a parent and then revisit this tweet.

BenedictEvans--17 Mar--@Feiring @andorand People are trying to break the fingerprinting
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--@CarolForden @awb58 No. One is a database lookup. The other is much more complicated.
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--@massivechange1 When people are deliberately trying to defeat that system, and obfuscate the file, it becomes a little more complicated than a database lookup.
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--@andorand Its an illustration of humanity
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--@JonoESmith It will not be the identical video, no. There will be a lot of deliberate obfuscation to try to make it harder to detect.

BenedictEvans--17 Mar--@ShanthaRMohan The 'breaking up' of them is so incoherent and meaningless a concept that it's hard to say what it's intended to achieve
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--@t_gordon States do not control markets - they regulate them, with consciousness of limitations and unintended consequences. That's the whole point. Indeed, the better China comparison would be with the 1960s.
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--@yami @kristinamonllos Is that what happened with Walmart?
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--We understand a market economy is a decentralized system. States  build roads &amp; pass laws but dont have total control. Eg: price controls dont work. Maybe we should think about the internet in the same way. Platforms build roads, but they do not have total control, and cannot.
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--@templecrash Google doesnt own links. Facebook data is stale very quickly. The data is apart from them. The data is us and changes all the time
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--If Google and Facebook are vast mechanical Turks, how much does machine learning lower the barriers to entry? What can many companies now know where previously you needed to capture the activities of billions of users? Is more data easier/different to more users?
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--Alternative: Google and Facebook are the dolphins in Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, without realizing it.
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--@mzrascoff Oh, all states at the time did that, to varying degrees. Id hesitate to make a direct link.
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--@LetsBeSapid People
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--Bonus: everyone thinks the king or the high priest controls the rain. In fact, he does himself. But he doesnt. He just builds the canal and waits.
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--Google/Facebook as Egypt or, better, one of the Mesopotamian kingdoms. Channel the water, build the irrigation and build the city with the surplus production. And every now and then a flood or barbarian horde wrecks everything and you have to start again.
BenedictEvans--17 Mar--Idly thinking you could see Google and FB as a little like the hydraulic states of the ancient world. They capture and channel or canalise the flow of these vast amounts of water as they move towards the ocean, and draw off enough to grow crops and build cities as it goes past
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@kevingibbon Browsers should not be required to make you choose which SSL stack you prefer.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@kevingibbon Creating confusion and hurting  trust in payment (and opening the door to fraud) is bad for developers. You have to begjn with whats good for users and work back. What payment option do I want? is not a question any user should ever have to ask.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@kevingibbon That is terrible for security, the user experience and developers.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@kevingibbon Why is 2.9% a fairer price than 30%?  What do other retailers charge?
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@kristineberth I think the key test is marginal cost. If Apple is giving you money and you have no marginal cost to get it, easy to argue its thats a positive. But if you have marginal cost for that, and Apples 30% swallows it, the conversation is entirely different.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@TravisWiedower No, those are respectively arguing about something else and misrepresenting the opposing argument.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@faneuman 278 issues since 3rd of March 2013.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@da5ch0 Apple doesnt design for the 0.1%
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@kristineberth No, thats a bad example, because this policy existed for a decade before Apple News. You cant understand it just in terms of Apple squashing competitors
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--Philosophers/rhetoricians lazyweb - what do you call it when you try to win an argument by redefining the meaning of the words used in the debate?
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--This brexit shambles has been going on so long were in danger of running out of GIFs.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--I think Apple could well revisit the gray area around in-app payments. I also think the idea that there should be more than one App Store on iOS is almost literally insane. To the extent it had any effect it would be entirely negative for users and probably developers as well.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@edwinheathcote In Japan this was called the three sacred treasures  a television, a refrigerator and a washing machine.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--Also: the problem with argument that Apples own books/music products get an unfair advantage is that this does not apply to news or magazines, where Apple didnt have its own competing product at all but applied the same rules.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@grahamterris I thought Apple didnt allow gambling apps?  
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@timbrooks100 Yes, and that was entirely quixotic. Theyre now back on the app store and better for it.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@bmtopol Frankly I think thats a side issue. They dont have a magazine but enforce the sane policy there.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@reyner I feel rather sorry for people who dont get this. But also jealous.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--So we get this weird flow: the Kindle app cant sell through IAP but Apple refuses to let it sell any other way. Not good for the user, which is Apples rationale. Meanwhile the absolute $ value of the App Store so large that at least the appearance of a conflict is created
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--Ebooks and music are interesting because theyre digital goods with marginal cost. Apples 30% might, mechanically, make the sale loss-making after paying the rights. An ebooks vendor often *cant* use IAP.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--There are clearly use-cases where it makes zero sense to use IAP (ride-share, or booking a flight). And there are cases where the Apple argument makes sense - random puzzle games should not be asking for a credit card.  But theres also a big middle ground...
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--I remember when Apple launched the in-app purchase rules, someone asked if Bloombergs app (subscription: $1,800/month) would have use it and give Apple 30%. Clearly no, but one got the impression it hadnt occurred to Apple.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@robleathern Well yes. But there are a lot.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@sbilstein @juancaviglia No-one thought PDA would be a universal product. They were always going to be niche for the high-end.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@michaeltoner In fact PocketPC came in 2000, and yes, people presumed that PDAs would be a small high-end niche. Ericsson had a PDA phone with a stylus in 1999.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--You could have got it 99% right, in wildly counter-consensus ways, and still missed the iPhone and Android.  Most of the stuff were trying to predict today is at about that stage. 3/3
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--If youd said all of that, youd have been a genius. And no-one would have believed you. Now, who will win in that scenario? Well obviously: Microsoft, Nokia and probably AOL. Certainly not a has-been 1980s PC maker and an obscure search engine. 2/3
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--Imagine if, in 2000, youd correctly predicted the future of the mobile internet: what would you have said? It needs to be a real computer with a real OS Flat-rate data Network operators and ISPs will play no role (&amp; iMode is a dead end) Apps, not the web, will dominate. 1/3
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--@adamnash @johnolilly You need . Especially now.
BenedictEvans--16 Mar--Ive been doing a newsletter every Friday for the last 6 years - my notes for the week, with what was interesting and why. There are now about 115k subscribers - you should sign up too. Its quite good.  https://t.co/FZf19oDkfa
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--I wish there was a way that I could tell Instagram that I will never buy a gym pant (whatever it might be), no matter how many companies want to sell me one.
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--Probably worth remembering that some of the early advocates of terrorism called it the propaganda of the deed.
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--@jameswallman No-one in the fashion industry would agree with that. The same for music - record companies do not decide whether punk or hip-hop will be the new thing. Read the link.
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--@nw3 I haven't opened Word in about 5 years.
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--(in a funny way, a lot of these productivity apps are actually very like social apps - they're trying to reassemble the basic building blocks we've had for years in new ways to create some new flash of delight - to remove some piece of friction or unlock a psychological insight)
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--That is, there is break apart and reassemble messaging/tables/tasks in better forms, and then there is Do this for me/find this for me/look at everything and show me whats important in SAP/SalesForce/enterprise security etc etc 4/4
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--OTOH, I wonder how much work, especially outside small startupy teams, is about collaborative work on shared documents and how much of the future is actually applying intelligence to grunt-work in single-threaded situations. 3/4
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--A commons thing about all the new generation of productivity apps is blurring the boundary between messaging and document, and between different document types. (This makes them more interesting than GDocs) 2/4
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--Theres an old joke that white-collar careers  progress either from Word to Outlook or from  Excel to Powerpoint to Outlook.  1/4
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--@jaygoldberg Another reason it was not a great film.
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--Old: generated learning. New: federated targeting.
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--@dkmj Read the memo, and my blog post.
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--@johnrobb that is not a conceptual change. it's still thousands of posts you can't read
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--@justinbrodeur the vast majority of people's networks are too large to see everything.
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--I think it's wrong to say, deterministically, that Facebook gets to decide what we do on its platform or what we see in the newsfeed. This, to me, is very like saying that a fashion designer gets to decide what we'll wear - or that a record label decides what we listen to
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--I also wrote a post explaining WHY Facebook (and Google) cannot make us eat our broccoli - that they have extremely limited control over what's in the feed or the search result. Also the only time you will see me talking about Punk. https://t.co/IF66QLVJud
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--@johnrobb That does not work well when there are thousands of posts per day in your feed.
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--@wingod That is several thousand posts a day. No-one has time for that
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--@karthikkalyan90 30% of zero is not a great alternative.
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--To put this another way: https://t.co/nSPOxAW7AM
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--Ive always thought Facebook surfs user behavior. It has to keep changing, because user behavior keeps changing, not least because of previous things Facebook (and other social networks) did. And its direct control over that is pretty limited. It cant make us eat our broccoli
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--All social apps grow until you need a newsfeed All newsfeeds grow until you need an algorithmic feed All algorithmic feeds grow until you get fed up of not seeing stuff/seeing the wrong stuff &amp; leave for new apps with less overload All those new apps grow until...
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--The algorithm begins as an attempt to apply common sense to those thousands of posts./ Who seem to be close friends? What seems more important? You can argue (oh god, we argue) about how well it works, but we can also ask if the whole model is sustainable.
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--This is what the desire for a chronological feed  - just show me everything! - misses. Everything is far more than anyone can ever look at.
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--The core challenge: you know a hundred+ people well enough to friend them, and we all post more and more. Multiple those two numbers together and the average FB user is eligible to see thousands of posts per day. Does an algorithmic feed solve that or do we go elsewhere?
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--Facebook says its pivoting away from the newsfeed. This is partly about safety, privacy and security - abuse is too easy. But its also worth wondering about product weaknesses in the newsfeed concept. I wrote this last year: the death of the newsfeed. https://t.co/8bubyoToI0
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--@bjm262run @ntaylor963 The whole point of the blog post was that moderation is not the answer.
BenedictEvans--15 Mar--Wondering if I have a blog post about Apple in-app payments from a decade ago, that I could just republish now in response to the Spotify complaint. Nothing much has changed in the arguments on each side.
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--First time Ive seen an AR app that was really convincing https://t.co/NDJdK2WXhy
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--@vijay_agrawal18 Read the link
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--I told you it was a pivot
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--Thread: Facebook is pivoting. https://t.co/hax3hNEA1u
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--@PeterBale @Channel4News Dont get me started on journalists calling every armored vehicle a tank or every military vessel a battleship
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--The things that people now demanded MSFT and FB do were the exact opposite of everything that had been demanded for the previous decade. Suddenly, MSFT deciding what code you can run, and FB deciding what you can share, was essential, instead of being evil.
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--One of the parallels: the criticism of Microsoft in the 90s was that it was too closed, and then we discovered that in important ways it was too open. The same for Facebook - people spent a decade criticizing FB for being too closed, and then we discovered it was too open.
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--@JasonHirschhorn Unless you find out its actually a spinal abscess. (True story)
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--@mblafkin @stevesi That is part of the response that I wrote about. And as I said, none of that actually solved the problem.
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--@antarcticdesign @ims43 @zeynep @CERN @facebook There is a long running discussion in tech around the trade-offs between security and safety in encryption. Asserting that anyone involved somehow wants to wash their hands if either part of that is wildly wrong.
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--@owenthomas Apple makes huge numbers of changes to iOS that dont get demos.
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--@antarcticdesign @ims43 @zeynep @CERN @facebook I hope that isnt what she says- it would be extraordinarily poor analysis.
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--Facebooks pivot towards messaging and end-to-end encryption is (partly) an attempt to do the same: changing the model so that the threat is irrelevant. But where the move to SaaS &amp; new operating systems happened largely without Microsoft, FB is trying to drive the change itself
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--For Microsofts malware problem, this was not the long-term answer: instead the industry fundamentally changed what security looked like by moving to SaaS and cloud and then to fundamentally different OS models (ChromeOS, iOS) that make the malware threat close to irrelevant.
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--Initial responses in both cases have taken two paths: tactical changes to development and API practices to try to make the existing model more secure, and attempts to scan for known bad actors and bad behavior (virus scanners then and human moderators now)
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--There are strong parallels between organised abuse of Facebook and FBs attempts to respond, in the last 24 months, and malware on Windows and Office and Microsofts attempts to respond, 20 years ago.
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--I wrote about Facebooks pivot. I think this is quite a big deal.  https://t.co/d6iC5vcGvL
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--@jkam92 Apples market share has been rising for close to two decades.
BenedictEvans--14 Mar--@jopas @johnmaeda I missed that thread, probably for the best. Its a series of aggressive and pretty hostile presumptions about what you imagine I might think, none of which I actually do think and none of which are reflected in what I actually said.
BenedictEvans--13 Mar--@gerrystiene @emeyerson @mertistan @CalebJHull and people get drunk and drive.
BenedictEvans--13 Mar--@emeyerson @mertistan @CalebJHull No. The loan is not for a leaky pipeline.
BenedictEvans--13 Mar--For lot of Apple software, they dont touch it for years, then do a big update, then ignore it for years. It seems frustrating for a power user (and very alien to the web) but I wonder if this is actually better for the non-technical billions than continuous small improvements.
BenedictEvans--13 Mar--@mertistan @CalebJHull So if you get a car loan, and then get drunk and crash into someone, the company that lent you the money is responsible? This is idiotic.
BenedictEvans--13 Mar--@justingern @Austen @paulg I have no view on US universities, but this is not a remotely supportable assertion for the UK. all the value is in the teaching.
BenedictEvans--13 Mar--I dont understand. I though computer systems were all easy to understand and audit and only machine learning has issues with opacity and explainability https://t.co/yDk0TKBSrE
BenedictEvans--13 Mar--@Austen @paulg It has a lot more to do with belief that admission is a random lottery and most people who are rejected could handle the courses just fine.
BenedictEvans--13 Mar--@VSexel @JAbro21 Academic admission not based on academics. Might want to work on your reading comprehension, kid.
BenedictEvans--13 Mar--@stenpittet @BlakeMaczka @HamonP Your hobby is not merit and has no relevance whatsoever to an academic institution
BenedictEvans--13 Mar--@rpetty You mean, where I said regulation is often very necessary?
BenedictEvans--13 Mar--@andrewchen @Quora MAU for a social app. More generally: use a frequency for activity thats relevant to the product.
BenedictEvans--13 Mar--@marcbienaime @BlakeMaczka @HamonP That is a hilariously ignorant assertion.
BenedictEvans--13 Mar--@JAbro21 Ask anyone outside the USA if they think university entry should be affected by who your father was or how good you are at sports and they will stare at you in disbelief. Its totally corrupt.
BenedictEvans--13 Mar--@JAbro21 I think entry to an academic institution should be a function of academic ability, and not how good you are at running in circles. Save that for your free time.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@Sharkyl That has nothing to do with a breakup.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@claire_atkin So... *dont* try to understand the dynamics of the tech industry and competition?
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@pip_net AT&amp;Ts breakup had no effect on telecom service competition and Microsoft was not broken up.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@troywolv Neither the PC nor the web were not created by the anti-trust action, and none of the sanctions therein had any effect on IBM or Microsofts position in relation to them. Anti-trust wasnt why enterprise software went to the cloud.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@Sharkyl It replacing a national monopoly with regional monopolies. What opportunities? Why not just mandate competitive long-distance, the way all other countries did? Why not unbundle the local loop?
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--None of this is to say regulation is a bad idea. Its often very necessary. But historically that has not been where generational changes came from in tech. 4/4
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--Tech anti-trust too often wants to insert a competitor to the winning monopolist, when its too late. Meanwhile, the monopolist is made irrelevant by something that that comes from totally outside the entire conversation and owes nothing to any anti-trust interventions. 3/4
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--But then the winner is overtaken by something completely different that makes it irrelevant. PCs overtook mainframes. HTML/LAMP overtook Win32. IOS &amp; Android overtook Windows. Google overtook Microsoft. 2/4
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--When a market is being created, people compete at doing the same thing better. Windows versus Mac. Office v Lotus. MySpace versus Facebook. Eventually, someone wins, and no-one else can get in. The market opportunity has closed. Be, NeXT/Path were too late.  Monopoly! But... 1/4
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--Apparently this is a treadmill for cats and I finally understand what late capitalism means.

BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@BlakeMaczka @HamonP The rest of the world manages to run universities just fine without giving special treatment to people who can run fast in circles.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@phonedude_mln That is not my reaction. Its a tangential observation about the corrupt nature of the entire system.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@kevingibbon No, thats fine. The Warren proposal is embarrassing.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@kevingibbon Literally nothing about her proposal makes any sense. There are arguments to make, but not those.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@joshgans Dictate into voice recorder then edit the transcript.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--Its hilarious that in America its bad to pretend to be an athlete to get a place at a university, but somehow OK to reserve places for athletes in the first place.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@CopticChad @ReformedBroker That has not been true for a century. Try harder.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--Descript is my blogging superpower.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@johngapper Then it would be time to leave.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@ReformedBroker The funny thing is, Europe doesn't have sports scholarships or legacy admissions.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@dylanhendricks I've explained half a dozen times why I think it is bad to talk about Amazon while totally ignoring the rest of the retail industry and the entire history of retail.
BenedictEvans--12 Mar--It is interesting that the first attempt to turn break them up into policy collapses under any kind of scrutiny. Sometimes thats what happens when a slogan sounds good but has nothing behind it.

BenedictEvans--12 Mar--@themoko @antoniogm Good journalists switch beats all the time. And covering an industry is not the same as covering war. Hate blinds you just as much as being a fan.

BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@iainmartin1 @t0nyyates @stephenkb I think the underlying point has more to do with the fact that you don't have to remember to go back. You can *susbcribe* to the content, and then it just comes to you. Doesn't have to be 'news' per se. And twitter is ephemeral - you miss stuff in the feed.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@aprilaser @danprimack Its pretty hard to know what it says given how hand-wavy it is. But thats not a bad summary.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@LA_Res_Tourist @at_man_liberty @sjpinches There is no historical topic in American that does not lead one to the history of racism. 
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@kenruf @planetmoney @linamkhan That is not necessarily true of physical retail, nor of Amazon. Sale or return on one hand and MOQs on the other.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--After a gap of 2 weeks (I was on planes), issue 278 of my newsletter just went out to 113,438 subscribers. https://t.co/NKeKGhB5e1
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@aweissman I triple-checked the date on this.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@TJSheth @pt @kimmaicutler @linamkhan I did, and wrote about it. The legal analysis is not my field, but the analysis of Amazon is not good. You cant just say investors pour money in when the company hasnt raised equity since 1997 and has had positive cash-flow since 2002.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--Talking about Amazons share of e-commerce rather than its share of retail feels just a little like talking about Netflixs share of streaming rather than its share of TV. Whats the actual market?
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@TJSheth @pt @kimmaicutler Well. Do we argue that Netflix should not be allowed to both buy and make shows? And that it has 80% of streaming (monopoly!) rather than 10% of TV?
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@at_man_liberty @sjpinches Lots of Swedes and Germans in the Midwest in 1908. The full catalogue is as thick as an old-fashioned telephone book.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@sjpinches https://t.co/XHkPPlHLdY
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@TJSheth @pt @kimmaicutler Ipso facto? No. Or, if it is, then we should apply the same rule to every other large retailer, since every large retailer has been doing exactly the same thing for the last 150 years. Either way, you need a thesis for WHY its bad (and for whom), not an assertion.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@TJSheth @pt @kimmaicutler because the detail is what is proposed, and it is full of embarrassing errors.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@pt @TJSheth @kimmaicutler No. The problem is that this proposal is both very specific and very vague. "You cannot sell on your own marketplace" is very specific, yet means Amazon would have to shut down 50% of its business, and there's no sign it understands that.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--I am honestly baffled that people think Amazon having in-house brands is something new. This is the 1908 Sears Roebuck catalogue. https://t.co/GTfu7yl067
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@dylanhendricks @mjmalone @ilyasu 1: there is no 'subsidy'. 2: every retailer for the last 150 years has had cheap in-house brands.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@pt @TJSheth @kimmaicutler The pitch doesnt have to be perfect. But you cant come out of the pitch and say that was a terrible answer, but they should have said X and then it would have been  great -  and then invest as though they HAD said X.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@fmbutt There are other things going on. Decline of spending on clothes, for one.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@pt @TJSheth @kimmaicutler That is not at all what I said.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@pt @TJSheth @kimmaicutler As I said - you evaluate what they pitched, not what you wish theyd pitched.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@nw3 @pt @TJSheth @kimmaicutler What do other retailers markup?
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@iandmacomber Its a retailer. Thats not the broadest possible definition. Its what it does.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@retailgeek @iandmacomber Step 1: define the market as the thing only that company does. Step 2: work out whether it has a monopoly...
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@iandmacomber Amazon is a retailer
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--(Reminder: Amazons target market is ALL OF RETAIL)
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@RHNilsson @linamkhan Not necessarily, but regardless, that is not what Amazon does. All retailers of any kinds sell some things below cost to drive traffic, but there is no basis for arguing Amazon does it more than anyone else or in the way you describe.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@or975 Amazons actual market is retail. 
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@TJSheth @pt @kimmaicutler Apple is not allowed to make iPhone apps if it has a monopoly on iPhones. This logic needs a LOT more work.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@business_inno @Daimler @BMW Orange worked out OK for a cellular network.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@nosao Microsoft made operating systems. Amazon is a retailer.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@TJSheth Key rule of investing: evaluate the pitch they gave, not the pitch that you would have given in their place.  Also, this would miss the target - Amazon (and Walmart and all other retailers) creates white-label product based on what it itself sells, not just whats in marketplace
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@lkanies Amazons market is all retail, not that portion of retail that is sold online today
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@lkanies I agree. I would add: dont trust people who ignore data.
BenedictEvans--11 Mar--@ryanchris Shit
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@TJSheth @pt @kimmaicutler This paragraph, taken at face value, means that Amazon has to either shut down Marketplace or stop selling on its own behalf on Amazon dotcom.  Marketplace is half of Amazon volume. https://t.co/sk2XG7mVft
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@TJSheth @pt @kimmaicutler Its exactly what the proposal calls for - almost certainly without realizing. That is the problem - its both specific and incoherent.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@ewiesen Read again. The question is not the lack of details. Its that there are details and they make no sense.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@saschasegan @kimmaicutler @stevesi @pt @Carnage4Life @superwuster Thai is the point exactly. The reasons Microsoft no longer dominates tech have zero to do with anti-trust. This is not an argument against anti-trust, but it is an argument against the presumption anti-trust is the only solution.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@saschasegan @kimmaicutler @stevesi @pt @Carnage4Life @superwuster (dont be pedantic)
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@PickardJE Never pile on. Hesitate to believe things that make you angry.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@kimmaicutler @stevesi @pt @Carnage4Life @superwuster I have never seen an explanation of why the MSFT antitrust caused Microsoft or indeed Nokia to miss smartphones.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@naturaporia Um, no. The problem is that this proposal is so unutterably vague and incoherent that it cant protect anyone from anything.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@stevesi @pt @Carnage4Life @kimmaicutler As we say, invest in what was pitched, not in what you would have pitched.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@pt @kimmaicutler The problem is that this proposal is specific enough to rise real questions, but too hand-wavy to answer them. If it said platform companies cannot abuse their control that would work. But this says You cant both sell on and run a platform... so half of Amazon is shut down
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@pt @kimmaicutler Clarity of understanding would produce clarity of proposals.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--(Its almost as though policy involves trade-offs )
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@polit2k @David_Ingram @kimmaicutler Taxes are paid on profits.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@AvS98765 @danheld San Francisco doesnt have that excuse.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@MarcAbrahams Im not exaggerating this one. Half of Amazons volume is marketplace. So is Amazon not allowed to sell something itself if someone -anyone- sells it on Marketplace? You cant just says you cant sell in your own marketplace without answering questions like that.

BenedictEvans--10 Mar--We dont want companies to give their profits to the people who own the company (dividends and buybacks are bad - remember). And we dont want them to do M&amp;A. And if they invest it in their business, their net income and hence tax bill goes down, and thats bad too.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@Leeefeldman @abrol_shiv Another example of why statista is spam that no-one should ever use. Global retail is over 20 trillion dollars and e-commerce is around a trillion.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@abrol_shiv @Leeefeldman Not exactly. But its not sensible to exclude those if you have any view of the next decade.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@chrisainsworth If you want to understand the role a company plays, knowing that number is a good idea.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@David_Ingram @kimmaicutler The fact that it would ban retailer private labels (invented 150 years ago) does not suggest much detailed thinking.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@kimmaicutler It feels like a grab bag of hand-waving complaints about anything  that made the front of the NYT tech section. App stores! Own-label products! Data!
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@Leeefeldman Correct
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@kimmaicutler Indeed. Sometimes breakups make sense, and sometimes they dont, but you do actually have to do the analysis, and not shout break them up! as though its the only answer
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@samanjar3d There is nothing brave in populism. Brave is telling people what they dont want to hear. Brave would be taking on gun control or healthcare
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@nw3 Do something is easy to say.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@samanjar3d The reaction reflects the incoherence of the proposals.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--Wondering if the vagueness of Warrens breakup tech idea, and its failure to consider the most basic questions it raises (eg: are you banning all retailers private labels?) reflects the nature of the whole break them up!  argument.  Theres no there there.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--Reminder: Amazon has a low single digit percentage share of US retail.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@hangingnoodles @econnaturalist This not a good response. SF has plenty of tax revenue. The problem is bureaucratic disfunction. Also, I have seen about 2 Ferraris in 5 years in the Bay Area -no-one buys expensive cars.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@mm_wonderland @rickdotta @mchowla @savagecolin @msuster There is nothing cynical in the desire to avoid pursuing policies that wont *work*

BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@mchowla @savagecolin @msuster American independence leaders were not revolutionary at all, and entirely moderate.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@burger @msuster I didnt say they were.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@savagecolin @msuster Moderate means that you understand complex problems do not have easy answers and that people who disagree with you about the best solutions to those problems  are usually neither evil nor stupid. The alternative to moderate almost always ends up as  Venezuela, or Stalin
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@msuster Charismatic politicians proposing easy answers are rarely a good thing, even - especially - if you agree with them about the problem.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--@misha_saul New Yorker is not just a literary magazine. NYRB/LRB are supposed to be
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--To generalize: We think tech is moving from to Y.  Company A (which we hate) depends on X, so its screwed. This applied perfectly to closed/open source and Microsoft, yet it didnt work out like that. No-one made a viable open-source desktop OS. We needed Android
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--But you need all three to align. So, open source was indeed the future, and everyone in tech loved to hate Windows, but Linux did not lay a finger on Windows on the desktop, and it didnt matter how much you said that open source was freedom.
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--There are tech theologies (eg open source, bitcoin); and there are industry trends (eg growth of GUIs or smartphones as dominant models); and there are things that find product-market fit (PCs in 1980s,, Linux winning servers). The world changes when all three match up. But...
BenedictEvans--10 Mar--The idea that Facebook woud be killed by owning/unbundling/fragmenting/federating your data reminds me a little of the very widespread idea in the late 1990s that open source in general and Linux on consumer desktops in particular would kill Microsoft

BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@kevingibbon This is exactly what supermarkets do.
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@kevingibbon You mean, like every other retailer in the history of organized retail?
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@kevingibbon @daveying99 You have under 5% of retail.
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@kevingibbon @daveying99 How is that different to physical retailers deciding what placement to give different goods? Brands pay well over a hundred billion dollars globally for that.
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@henkvaness @CraigSilverman Neutral to whom? Is it perhaps possible that people in different countries entering a given keyword might want different things?
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@daveying99 @kevingibbon I am especially baffled by people complaining about Amazon own-label products what its exactly what every large retailer has done for 100 years.
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@kevingibbon As you might see from my thread - what do you break it up into? How is this different to break up wal-mart? There is no cross-leveraging of unrelated units here. You might want intervention, but I have never seen a serious analysis of what a breakup would actually be
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@kevingibbon Personally, I don't like policies that are based on nonsensical reasoning, regardless of whether I might or might not like the outcome.
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@Sharkyl @itsvarora You're missing the point.A company can have a dominant position that looks invulnerable, until it doesn't.

BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@hemal IMO this is a platform level solution that should disappear to *any* end user,  just like defragmentation disappeared. Apple Pay on the web is an interesting parallel - the vendor doesnt get your card.
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--Talking my parents through changing their passwords (so that theres a different one on each site) makes about as much sense as having to defragment their hard disks
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@Sharkyl Amazons market is retail. Nokias market was mobile phone handsets. That is a direct equivalence.
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@Sharkyl Amazon has low single digit share of US retail.
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@Sharkyl Nokia had total domination of the handset market and looked totally invulnerable
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--(It is utterly bizarre to me that anyone can look at the last 25 years of tech and conclude that any company is invulnerable to change. Ask Nokia how its competitive advantage in phones lasted.)
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@joelaberger Read the thread again. It is very very clear as to why those examples do not apply.
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@DavidDRobbins @ewarren If she does understand it, her plan as reported deliberately ignores it
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--A successful intervention (presuming such is needed) will need very good work in anti-trust (and need to be aware there is a world outside the USA. Get a passport, people) AND proper, rigorous industrial analysis. Investors subsidize Amazon to sell at a loss is embarrassing.
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--A fascinating aspect of this was the very widely discussed Harvard Law piece on Amazon and anti-trust. On one hand, US anti-trust doesnt know what to do with a monopoly with low prices. On the other, its analysis of *Amazon* was painfully vague and inaccurate.
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@Antonlovesdnb The specifics proposed in that piece fail all of these tests. They would make no sense, have no effect or both. WTF is Waze on any list of Googles market power?
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--@PublishersLunch And amazons book business is a tiny part of the company - even if you shut it down nothing would change.
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--If you think some intervention is needed against some industry or company, you need to define what exactly the harm youre addressing is (theyre big is not good enough), and how the specific remedy you propose changes that. Break it up is not a policy analysis.
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--Meanwhile, arguing you should split up Amazon is like splitting up Walmart - into what? Its a single logistics platform (and no, AWS is not subsidizing the rest of the business. Read the accounts).
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--So, splitting AT&amp;T by region just replaced a national monopoly with regional monopolies. Not a success. And you could argue for splitting YouTube from Google or Instagram from Facebook, but what does that do to the strength of Search or the Newsfeed?
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--Plus, you have to ask whether the breakup actually changes the issue that you want to address.
BenedictEvans--08 Mar--Breaking up a company presumes you identify separate , stand-alone units that are being cross-leveraged unfairly. You could have made that argument about Windows and Office. But it doesnt automatically apply to any big company you want action against.

BenedictEvans--02 Mar--@corrine Its the scenario in which we live in the real world and are confronted all the time by data from all sorts of places that we cannot get in any digital format at all.
BenedictEvans--02 Mar--@rubencodes @devenpsatam You cant give everyone in an office a scanner, and theyre slow and impractical for this use case. You want something you can use at your desk as part of your workflow.
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--Oops https://t.co/b4CfLnzRnx
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--@devenpsatam Laptops dont have cameras. You need a way to ingest the image. That has to happen in a phone. The only question is what app.
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--@mims Live the power of next
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--@devenpsatam This is part of a huge number of peoples lives.
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--@patphelan https://t.co/lxxcoXHOqI
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--This is the greatest step forward in financial analysis since the spreadsheet. https://t.co/1XXPVGj1vr
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--@alexgoldmark A better example would be steel, drills or indeed databases. We dont expect machine tools manufacturers to handle gun control. You can do immoral things with anything, but ML is just a tool, and a very low level one. So pick the right level.
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--@neozero497 @katecrawford No, they are way behind Waymo. No-one in the field would put them anywhere near the lead.
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--@scottalbro I believe Chinatown thought they would lose business.
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--@KimKLarsen @neozero497 @katecrawford Yes, the whole concept that racist AI cars will hit black people is ludicrous.
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--@Dealfatigue Not exactly- it just made it unavoidable
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--The fact that the people of San Francisco voted to keep that thing a few years earlier tells you almost all you need to know https://t.co/YFKF88OmFn
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--@neozero497 @katecrawford Tesla does not have an autonomous system.
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--@gspeng @Andrew_Wyld @katecrawford The same for all the sensors - this is why we use all of them.
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--@seanmmcdonald No, Im pointing out that there is no such thing as AI. There are many different systems built using the same underlying technologies for different purposes.
BenedictEvans--01 Mar--@seanmmcdonald If you put dishes in the washing machine, who should get the blame for the consequences? Is that a fault in the design of the washing machine?
SirajRaval--27 Mar--My highest excitement in life is educating people on the most empowering technology of 2019 - Artificial Intelligence! Learning AI will enable you to have true financial freedom, better health, and more fulfilling relationships. Expect me to show you how in the coming weeks.
SirajRaval--27 Mar--2019 is the perfect year to build an AI startup! I'm going to show you the process it takes to go from idea, to programmatic development, to finding your first paying customer by building an AI medical diagnosis app https://t.co/2Y4ZAoiT6W
SirajRaval--26 Mar--"Watch Me Build an AI Startup" drops in 14 hours 
SirajRaval--26 Mar--Automatically classifying, summarizing, &amp; even generating text has become really simple in 2019. In this episode, I'll share the recent advances in Natural Language Processing that have made this possible &amp; build an Amazon product summarizer https://t.co/MzGPD3ahCY
SirajRaval--24 Mar--Nvidia invited me to their annual conference, so I took that opportunity to interview their VP of Applied Deep Learning Research @ctnzr . I asked him 67 questions about AI research &amp; his personal life while walking through the hall https://t.co/aiImFsZvey #GTC2019
SirajRaval--24 Mar--@MattyBv3 @AndrewYang @joerogan @elonmusk Yang gang!
SirajRaval--22 Mar--Love is the objective function
SirajRaval--22 Mar--Data literacy is a skill every human needs to master! It applies to every aspect of our lives, from personal health, to business development, to artistic expression, to scientific discovery. Using AI to make data driven decisions will help us live happier &amp; more meaningful lives.
SirajRaval--20 Mar--Interview with @lexfridman (MIT AI instructor) coming soon https://t.co/0oYo2MGrfP
SirajRaval--19 Mar--I'm going to attempt to crack a password in a SQL database to help fight crime in this video. In order to do so, we'll have to learn about the fundamental topics in Discrete Math (combinatorics, graph theory, set theory, number theory, logic, &amp; recursion) https://t.co/ywH7HiwgLQ
SirajRaval--15 Mar--Discrete Math is a subject everyone interested in Computer Science needs to understand. It consists of math branches like graph theory, set theory, number theory, &amp; combinatorics. It helps create databases, algorithms, &amp; security structures. I'll explain it in my video next week
SirajRaval--12 Mar--AI can help us find insights hidden in the depths of health data that will improve automated diagnosis, drug discovery, and synthetic biology. In this keynote and panel discussion, you'll learn about it in depth https://t.co/BjCydg4BCO  #HealthHack
SirajRaval--11 Mar--80% of the world's data is unstructured! The promise of unsupervised learning is finding the hidden structure in the noise, and its perhaps the most important AI research goal of 2019. I'll attempt to save a life with it in this episode https://t.co/FNHHBdKZ5f
SirajRaval--08 Mar--Shoutout to all the amazing women in the School of AI community! (9%) Together, we'll use technology to empower women in every country to live out their aspirations without limits. https://t.co/dlU0e0vYJo #InternationalWomensDay
SirajRaval--07 Mar--@Xavya @Intuit @turbotax @QuickBooks @mintapp thanks! And yea its @mint not mintapp
SirajRaval--07 Mar--Everyone who uses major internet services already uses trained machines, but programmers are currently the only ones that train them. Code is one interface to train machines to learn from data, but there will be more coming! (Drag and drop apps, voice control, mind-body machines)
SirajRaval--07 Mar--In his 'Descent of Man', Darwin mentioned 'love' 95 times and 'survival of the fittest' twice. Hatred, anger, jealousy, these emotions negatively affect our body's organs. We're designed for love and compassion, it's just that our algorithms haven't yet aligned with our nature.
SirajRaval--07 Mar--@_Wh00Cares_ passing regulations that value people over profit, GDPR is one example. Also creating apps that value a user's time well spent over their attention
SirajRaval--07 Mar--@adamspaceship lol sick i'll be back to visit in the summer, love amsterdam
SirajRaval--07 Mar--In the 1800s, London smelled terrible due to industrialization. The solution was building an industrial-scale sewer system. In 2019, the internet is rife with manipulative and exploitative algorithms. This is digital pollution, pollution of our minds, and its time to clean up.
SirajRaval--07 Mar--@steven_nikolic @Intuit @turbotax @QuickBooks @mintapp thanks Steven for the feedback. Learning as I go
SirajRaval--07 Mar--@Xavya @Intuit @turbotax @QuickBooks @mintapp yes its an ad
SirajRaval--07 Mar--I admire how @Intuit creates tools, @TurboTax, @QuickBooks, &amp; @MintApp, to help people achieve their financial goals. Check out how they use machine learning to enable people to have greater financial freedom https://t.co/q9KcrcUaqT #PoweringProsperity

ReshmaSaujani--29 Mar--Perfection has us hardwired to think if we don't know the answer to something, we're inept. But it's not true, we just don't know the answer 'yet'. @LifeAtPurdue hosted a #WHM2019 panel on how a bravery mindset will help their students' future careers:

ReshmaSaujani--25 Mar--38 colleges in the US have more students from top 1% than from the bottom 60%. You all need to read @tony_jack new book The Privileged Poor. https://t.co/vYth62PwPJ
ReshmaSaujani--25 Mar--Everything @katiecouric wrote is exactly right. We are hindering our girls from a young age.

ReshmaSaujani--21 Mar--Remember when you were a kid and would feel the wind in your hair when riding your bike, bliss. Don't lose that feeling, be brave.

ReshmaSaujani--20 Mar--@UNYouthEnvoy Just DMed you!!
ReshmaSaujani--20 Mar--No pro athlete, world leader, CEO, actress, etc. had everything perfected before they started. You'll be inspired after this week's episode on the #bravenotperfect podcast to get caught trying like @RMaxkii, an activist and a self-taught coder. Listen: https://t.co/5eNoLRcHG2
ReshmaSaujani--20 Mar--Such a beautiful evening celebrating the power of bravery and the @resiliencefnd https://t.co/xoZyfnO0X2
ReshmaSaujani--20 Mar--Bravery is leaving your corporate job to follow your passion, which is just what @EmilyWWeiss did to start @glossier .... and look at where she is today. congrats #braveryboss
ReshmaSaujani--19 Mar--Being the first is a powerful form of activism. When you break ground and become the first, you open the door for other women to do the same. Thats how we all get stronger, one brave act at a time. #bravenotperfect https://t.co/I4p49KzSrD
ReshmaSaujani--19 Mar--From getting placed into CS classes, feeling comfortable in their learning environment, being accepted to top programs, getting an interview followed by the job offer, to receiving funding... the gender gap in tech is bigger than taking a course. 
ReshmaSaujani--18 Mar--Sending love &amp; our deepest condolences to @learningcode &amp; the family and friends of Danielle Moore. Danielle dedicated her life to building a more inclusive future, and we can, and should, all learn from her example. She'll surely be missed by the tech community. https://t.co/JPcHPkVHdA

ReshmaSaujani--15 Mar--Bravery is a daily practice &amp; like any practice, you'll fall on and off the wagon. I do and I wrote a book on it!

ReshmaSaujani--13 Mar--When I decided to be #bravenotperfect, I gave myself permission to live authentically and space to fail. Failure (two VERY public ones) gave me the courage to start @GirlsWhoCode &amp; change the lives of thousands of girls. 
ReshmaSaujani--13 Mar--@5x15stories @joe_thomas25 @HQstories @MsLisaMilton Thanks for having me!
ReshmaSaujani--13 Mar--@NooJones @BBCWomansHour It's crazy, right? I really do think bravery can be the antidote. You can pick up a copy of my book, Brave, Not Perfect that can help, too!
ReshmaSaujani--13 Mar--Perfectionism holds us back financiallyfrom going for that promotion, asking for a higher salary, or leaving a job that undervalues us. I sat down with the founder of @ladiesgetpaid, @clairewasserman to about this on #bravenotperfect podcast. Tune in:

ReshmaSaujani--06 Mar--Say it louder for the people in the back
ReshmaSaujani--06 Mar--@ariannahuff @GirlsWhoCode Thanks for your endless support. Youre amazing #sisterhood
ReshmaSaujani--06 Mar--@sswarner12 @InsideMastercrd @MastercardNews Thanks for having me!!
ReshmaSaujani--06 Mar--Bravery is doing the right thing when everyone else asks you to sit down. So proud of my friend @AOC for her fearless leadership #bravenotperfect
ReshmaSaujani--06 Mar--A girl asked me at @mastercardnews how do I be brave without everyone saying those millennials are so entitled? My response: they cant get rid of all of u! Bravery is contagious (now Im not saying ask for a promo 2 weeks in) but when u live ur fullest life, it will catch on
ReshmaSaujani--06 Mar--Meeting the future changemakers of our country has truly been the highlight of my #BraveNotPerfect book tour. Look at these stars!!! This morning, Im talking bravery with @MastercardNews CFO, Martina Hund-Mejean. https://t.co/wktVMaSUuA
ReshmaSaujani--06 Mar--Playing for Team Brave will change your life. Listen in to my conversation with @susanmcp1, the connector, angel investor and entrepreneur, now on this weeks episode of #BraveNotPerfect podcast 
ReshmaSaujani--06 Mar--Being bold and fearless is @badassbozs brand. Check out her feature in @Adweek. Shes a marketing genius and she shares some tips on how bravery will change your life. #BraveNotPerfect 
ReshmaSaujani--05 Mar--In the last 24 hrs, @RomeJHartman, you've amplified the message of @hadip, while ignoring account from us, @ayahbdeir &amp;thousands of others who've said, explicitly, they feel erased. This is how toxic culture forms. Who is on TV matters. Bravery is being able to do the right thing https://t.co/K3dxXwvLzY
ReshmaSaujani--05 Mar--@DeannaSoukup @GirlsWhoCode @LSR7 @MartieSchrecke2 @thatgirl0203 @zsears22 @snailgrapedsoda @squidle102002 Love this!!! Welcome to the #sisterhood!

ReshmaSaujani--05 Mar--The @60minutes story is worse than we than we thought..The original story was about @ayahbdeir + @littleBits. She recommended additional orgs to speak to then once the producers got what they needed, they decided to make it about a man and told her you are a 'casualty.' Read this https://t.co/K3dxXwvLzY
ReshmaSaujani--05 Mar--Wow, @HadiP @60minutes. Praise for your segment from @ivankatrump and an administration that marginalizes women and girls every day. Pretty damning. https://t.co/S726p34imq
ReshmaSaujani--05 Mar--I am in. Can't wait. https://t.co/FecRmrl5Mx
ReshmaSaujani--05 Mar--@EdTechAri Thank you for writing this
ReshmaSaujani--05 Mar--@QuincyTennyson @GirlsWhoCode Exactly, the power of sisterhood is everything
ReshmaSaujani--04 Mar--If any media wants to hear how @60Minutes took a story about closing the gender gap in tech and cut women out of it pls DM me. And while youre at it talk to @BrendaDardenW, @KarlitaLiliana, @6gems &amp; @dr_nickiw
ReshmaSaujani--04 Mar--@AmeliaWissink The sisterhood is always here for you! Keep being a star
ReshmaSaujani--04 Mar--Today, I met with a @girlswhocode Club in CA. While I was angry about the @60minutes piece last night, after seeing my girls, I was furious. Despite their work, they're continuingly being ignored by those in power. I won't let them be overlooked anymore.
ReshmaSaujani--04 Mar--Love this!! The power of #sisterhood is everything! https://t.co/kYcDnLl8Lt
ReshmaSaujani--04 Mar--Hey @RomeJHartman - still waiting (along with thousands of others) for @60Minutes to explain why your story abt the gender gap in tech excluded women-led orgs that *actually* focus on girls. What gives?https://t.co/n1nDaLAw90
ReshmaSaujani--04 Mar--Outpouring of support in my inbox with viewers disturbed by @60Minutes biased story. Its hard speaking truth to power, but its the right thing to do. @60Minutes, now its your turn. Will you run a 2nd segment ft. the work of women-led orgs? Cc @szirinsky @LesleyRStahl @Hadip https://t.co/hZkMnvW16X
ReshmaSaujani--04 Mar--Yes the girls were amazing and I am so disappointed that @60Minutes cut you and them out.  Please remind them that their contributions matter and @GirlsWhoCode loves them. https://t.co/KKhowTJNVA
ReshmaSaujani--04 Mar--How did @60Minutes @CBSNews just do a segment on girls in coding featuring a man as the savior of women in tech? Cc @szirinsky @SharynAlfonsi @LesleyRStahl @Hadip https://t.co/zCtf85cYEX
ReshmaSaujani--04 Mar--Never thought bravery would mean calling out @60minutes but here I am. They just aired a segment on the gender gap in tech without mentioning @GirlsWhoCode or any women orgs. Girls, this ones for you. #bravenotperfect 
ReshmaSaujani--03 Mar--@CESLibraryMC @nihalmehta Proud of you!
ReshmaSaujani--03 Mar--So proud of you!!!!! https://t.co/l1QGsgoeK3
ReshmaSaujani--03 Mar--This made my day. When you teach a girl to code, she will make a difference in the world and support the #sisterhood. Audrey Isabel Pe, you are such an inspiration to me!!!

ReshmaSaujani--01 Mar--@Jmsteinbrink I was too! The best way to break up with perfection is to practice small acts of bravery every day. Start by imperfection, send an email with a typo in it today
