ChristopherMims--09 May--This is a profound and important set of insights.

BenedictEvans--27 May--For any innovation that involves money, fraud is an inevitable part of the adoption curve. And today, any consumer internet innovation probably means hundreds of millions of users, and anything with the attention of hundreds of millions of people can involve money.
BenedictEvans--27 May--(Yes, but... 143 posts in 18 months and 2.6m followers? ) https://t.co/JoGnZDvDqq
BenedictEvans--27 May--A challenge of experience- you know that x wont work, and that people keep trying it because they dont know this. But one day something might change and it might become possible, or someone might find a new way in. And youll miss this because you just say oh, not that again
BenedictEvans--27 May--Playing a little with newsletter cohort analysis. 3,053 people signed up to my newsletter in January 2018. 180 had dead email addresses 12 months later. Given half are personal addresses (gmail etc), implies about 12% annual job turnover in the base (?)

BenedictEvans--26 May--Posit: a common factor between people will do bad things with machine lending and people are saying bad things on the internet is scaling, or automation. Scaling from one person does it to one person does it and affects a million people 1/
BenedictEvans--26 May--A few decades ago, there were a bunch of books on how databases would destroy democracy, and now we have books on how machine learning (artificial intelligence) will do that. But were there any of those kinds of books written about spreadsheets?
BenedictEvans--26 May--I do a newsletter on Sunday nights with my notes for the week - what was interesting and what it meant. After 6 years, there are now about 120k subscribers. Its pretty good, I think.  https://t.co/FZf19oDkfa
BenedictEvans--25 May--I wish San Francisco had better options for places to meet people during the day besides perching on a shared bench in a coffee shop
BenedictEvans--25 May--Wondering how much one should put podcasts in the same category as email newsletters (though much bigger): new (or newly hot) content form with lower friction to create, plus new and half-empty distribution channel offering a chance to grab an audience in virgin territory.
BenedictEvans--25 May--A big part of the EV narrative has been that range matters less than you think. So, as the first real non-Tesla EVs arrive in the market and dont yet have quite the same range as a Tesla, does that matter or not? (That is, theres a danger of having your cake and eating it here)
BenedictEvans--25 May--Id not have guessed the US was so far down the chart. https://t.co/u7TqnJ8SPD https://t.co/TEUqmJVK4t
BenedictEvans--25 May--Its much easier to dismiss current proposals for regulating tech than to work out more useful ones. Explaining why break them up! or ban app stores! make no sense is like shooting fish in a barrel. Working out the specific problems you want so solve, and how, is much harder
BenedictEvans--25 May--16 pristine acres of office park  https://t.co/r8uJM2kgVf
BenedictEvans--25 May--Talking recently with someone in government about attitudes outside tech to info-security, it seemed interesting to compare this with fire safety a century ago. There was a time when no-one really took this seriously, and didnt bother spending the money, and that ended.
BenedictEvans--25 May--Talking about AI https://t.co/VXUr4Tsa9u
BenedictEvans--25 May--I wore this post 4 years ago: Microsoft, capitulation and the end of Windows Everywhere, at the point that Microsoft gave up on being the main computing platform and looked instead to the future. Its turned out pretty well.  https://t.co/J1pXLwC1CK
BenedictEvans--25 May--Idle observation: there are now perhaps 200m more iPhones than consumer PCs in use on earth.
BenedictEvans--25 May--How on earth do you write a whole book about  court cases in 19th century Britain and not look up the legal terminology or read the newspaper reports of the trials? Asking for a friend.
BenedictEvans--24 May--Idly wondering how someone can go through the US university tenure process and then argue that human organisations (unlike machine learning) have transparent and easily-audited decision-making processes.
BenedictEvans--24 May--Now imagine if the car was big enough to carry dozens of people, and you linked a bunch of them together, and ran a regular service along lines that linked dozens or hundreds of locations around the city. https://t.co/eefF0X6N3t
BenedictEvans--24 May--I saw someone asleep at the wheel of a Tesla on the freeway today. I honked and he woke up. Glass half empty or half full?
BenedictEvans--23 May--Idly occurs to me that if Facebook gets better at detecting fake accounts, both the number of fake accounts reported AND the number of *attempts* to create fake accounts should go up.
BenedictEvans--23 May--Fascinating data from FB on takedown of abusive/fake content. Note both the volume of attempts, and the success rate in detection.  Some things are harder to spot than others.  https://t.co/jcXAup5v7M

BenedictEvans--23 May--Apple Music today feels like the iOS App Store before it was relaunched.
BenedictEvans--23 May--One thing that confuses me about Huawei - people ask whether the PRC government owns it, as though that would mean it can use Huawei products for spying/control, but if the Chinese government asked any other Chinese company to insert XYZ, could they say no?

BenedictEvans--21 May--Old: unbundle Excel into a new vertical app New: unbundle Google Sheets into a new vertical app.
BenedictEvans--21 May--Calendars allocate time slots, but without any actions. Todo lists allocate actions, but without time slots. Email is a todo list anyone can edit, but without actions or time slots allocated Then people use calendar invites as email, and email for calendaring
BenedictEvans--21 May--5G: if you build it, we will fill it. https://t.co/2Eh6MAWsCZ
BenedictEvans--21 May--So bizarre what American cities did to themselves https://t.co/Drm3hOn54X
BenedictEvans--21 May--Reminder: yes, 5G can do a gigabit/sec - if you have direct line of sight to a base station within a few hundred yards. It doesnt work indoors. At the frequencies used to get those speeds, that probably wont change much. This is about physics, not deployment.

BenedictEvans--20 May--Comment over the weekend - theres a turf war in academia for who gets to be critics of tech. Everyone tries to invent new terms as a way to frame the debate and move it into their own ground. You want your book title to set the narrative
BenedictEvans--20 May--Every now and then I see really interesting discussions of the future of Netflix in my feed. None of these conversations are about tech - theyre about TV.  None of the questions are tech questions - theyre TV questions.
BenedictEvans--19 May--Netflix will reportedly spend $15bn on new programming this year. https://t.co/97DCIxv7ps
BenedictEvans--19 May--Somehow it is not even a tiny bit surprising that the New York taxi medallion bubble (and subsequent wave of driver bankruptcies) was driven by insider manipulation, predatory loans and a complicit regulator https://t.co/tUzWIepXO4
BenedictEvans--19 May--Does anyone still think Alexa is the new platform after mobile?
BenedictEvans--18 May--Why do Americans call children Scooter but not Bicycle, Car or Buggy?
BenedictEvans--18 May--Interesting recurrent theme in talking about regulation: the US and the rest of the developed world have a fundamentally different attitude to what it is, how it operates and how effective it could be.
BenedictEvans--18 May--We still havent really solved sharing presentations online. Slideshare is effectively dead. YouTube has decent quality, social and a talk track, but people have to devote the 30 minutes to watching. A blog post talking about all the slides changes the form too much. Etc.

BenedictEvans--17 May--Rules for twitter: dont retweet any news that makes you angry unless it comes from a really reliable source. Block, instantly, anyone you see attacking anybody who isnt a public figure. Presume good faith. And dont argue with the crazy people.
BenedictEvans--17 May--Idly wondering how Hollywoods production volume now compares to peak Hollywood in the 1930.
BenedictEvans--17 May--The three waves in tech today: machine learning, bitcoins and regulation.
BenedictEvans--16 May--A nice Google Analytics infinite loop: Support page for "install Optimize with Analytics.JS" says go to this screen. This screen says "If you use analytics.js, go to this page" Guess what page that is. 
BenedictEvans--16 May--If you think of Autopilot as "I drive, and it will stamp on the brakes for me if necessary", it saves lives. The problem comes when you think of it as "Autopilot drives, but I should try to be ready to stamp on the brakes if necessary"

BenedictEvans--16 May--I have often had this problem https://t.co/ebi6xlXcji
BenedictEvans--15 May--The SF face recognition ban gets to some interesting issues. Some of the concern is that it might get things wrong. But people are also uncomfortable even if its accurate. Theres a class of things that were possible but couldnt be automated, and now can be.
BenedictEvans--15 May--Has anyone analysed the traffic effects of buildings going from two separate bathrooms to one larger gender-neutral one? (No puns please)
BenedictEvans--14 May--Last week in the NY Times : banning advertising would end abuse and manipulation on social networks. This week on Bloomberg: encryption has no security benefits.  Thinking about underlying causes of this stuff.
BenedictEvans--13 May--Posit: in software design, the more choices you give the user, the more youre really reinforcing the defaults the developer wants. If you have two switches, the user might use them. If you have 200, the user wont touch any of them. That is, more choice = fewer choices made
BenedictEvans--13 May--Meta observation: this was more interesting news at Google IO than anything about Pixel. (Also - the do we want privacy or competition? question, illustration one of very very many) https://t.co/GLTM0I7D8u

BenedictEvans--11 May--IPO price went up on the day? Bad!  IPO price went down on the day? Bad! New arguments here in the last twenty years? Zero.
BenedictEvans--11 May--The three stages of big tech companies: insurgent, monopolist, were returning to relevance with professional services.
BenedictEvans--11 May--An interesting topic that comes up repeatedly, when I talk about tech power and anti-trust: a lot of people dont quite understand that where once Microsoft had total dominance of tech, with everyone in tech worrying what it would do, this is not the case today.
BenedictEvans--11 May--Tech monopolies tend not to fall like Rome. They fall like Venice. Theyre still there, and no-one actually invades them, but the trade routes moved, the things that gave them power and wealth stop mattering, and they become just another city, and then a backwater.
BenedictEvans--11 May--Annotation. https://t.co/LSjIvqUvX5
BenedictEvans--11 May--Every Sunday, I send out an email newsletter with my notes for the week - the news that actually matters and what it might mean, plus the most interesting links I saw. There are now around 115,000 subscribers. You should sign up too - its pretty good.  https://t.co/FZf19oDkfa
BenedictEvans--09 May--Edit  https://t.co/qrNrjyv43T
BenedictEvans--09 May--I suspect one lesson for becoming a millionaire is not to spend all your time posting pictures of sports cars on Instagram. https://t.co/CzQ7gGxjeX
BenedictEvans--09 May--Breaking up Facebook and Google is a common part of the political and tech narrative today. It seems sensible to ask what that would or wouldnt achieve .  https://t.co/q5BiMO6X6R
BenedictEvans--09 May--All social networks capture and create human behavior. Some of that behavior is bad, sometimes in unforeseen ways. Its not clear  that changing who owns those network, for example having FB blue and WhatsApp in different companies, would change this.
BenedictEvans--09 May--LinkedIn is the New Craigslist  https://t.co/QwnavmkJyO

BenedictEvans--08 May--(Mail geek question: what's wrong with my SPF? Looks fine to me. And does it matter?) https://t.co/HExGGK1goV
BenedictEvans--08 May--I always wonder why the cloud that rolls into the SF bay area is so clearly defined. More like a blanket than cloud https://t.co/hGYqVScEMF
BenedictEvans--07 May--I have the same question for Google Pixel as I do for Apple television: what is the budget? For both, being a real player means spending $5-10bn a year. Otherwise this is just marketing, option value or experiments.
BenedictEvans--07 May--The two stages of computational photography: 1: The photo is always perfect 2: The phone knows why you took the picture, whats in it, and offers to dial the phone number in the image
BenedictEvans--07 May--(Am I the only one who sees this stage and thinks of the sunflower iMac?) https://t.co/CBQmByvY56
BenedictEvans--07 May--Federated learning is appealing to Apple (we dont have your data!), useful for Google (lots of good technical use cases), but maybe a strategic imperative for Facebook. How else to do ads, track preferences and catch abuse if everything is encrypted when it leaves the phone?
BenedictEvans--07 May--Google: there are now 2.5bn active Android devices. Developer dashboard says 95% are phones: say 2.4bn Apple said 900m iPhones in January Chinese Android (not in Googles stats) phones are ~650m Total: 4bn smartphones in use today, out of 5bn total mobile phones (&amp; 5.5bn adults)
BenedictEvans--07 May--Do we have a release date for Huaweis folding phone? Or has that gone quiet?
BenedictEvans--07 May--We need tech companies to create back  doors in their products and give them to governments, because theyll keep them safe https://t.co/CiLccXzz6W https://t.co/wv4wya4EUS
BenedictEvans--07 May--The way to judge the winners of the Met Gala is to look at their Instagram followers before and after.  And their endorsement rates.
BenedictEvans--07 May--Theres an awful lot of unsupported assumptions in here. Fundamentally, I do not understand, at all, why a social network that has no ads would have no disinformation problems. WhatsApp has no ads. It has this problem.  https://t.co/PyPu6lC3xl
BenedictEvans--07 May--For every new form of media, the older generation worries that its bad for the mental health of the younger generation. For novels as for comics, rock and roll, arcade games, or now, probably, screen time.
BenedictEvans--07 May--Does social media make teenagers unhappy? (No, not really) https://t.co/L88sBqLBhN
BenedictEvans--06 May--The weird thing about a newsletter is that most of the unsubscribes come when you send it out.

BenedictEvans--06 May--The future of video calling https://t.co/HVRKH7EL1e
BenedictEvans--06 May--Status https://t.co/XZsN9f1sy6
BenedictEvans--06 May--Maybe there should be some sort of conference where all the people from cities/regions / countries that want to build tech ecosystems could get together.
BenedictEvans--06 May--Old: messaging apps are portals for other services (Wechat) New: maps apps are portals Next: camera apps are portals
BenedictEvans--05 May--I would quite like a machine learning system that generates scary headlines about AI
BenedictEvans--05 May--moir https://t.co/JQbSETtPWu
BenedictEvans--05 May--When it happens to you twice: Shanghai, 1949: two White Russians discuss the communist takeover.  I wonder what happened to them. https://t.co/ja01gG53vZ
BenedictEvans--05 May--This is one of my favorite every pieces of forecasting, for Telegeography in 1990: What does the Fax tell us about the future of communications? https://t.co/rPhx8ZyAAF
BenedictEvans--05 May--In the early 1980s, the Indian minister responsible for the state telecoms monopoly said people should stop complaining. The fact that there was an 8 year waiting list to get a phone proved how popular this supposedly terrible service was. https://t.co/XNeBceG2He
BenedictEvans--05 May--Still mourning Skandium 
BenedictEvans--04 May--Legal question: if Assange had gone to Sweden, been convicted, gone to prison, then been extradited to the USA, convicted, and gone to prison again - after all that, would he be out of prison by now?
BenedictEvans--04 May--Going through F8 presentations and thinking more about what I write about them in March: that this looks like a really radical change. 1/
BenedictEvans--04 May--A a certain point in your life you realise youve bought more books than youll be able to read before you die. (This can be a depressing thought, so better cheer yourself up, by buying more books.)
BenedictEvans--04 May--Idle observation: 2/3 to 3/4 of Google and Facebooks ad business is from companies that never bought print advertising other than Yellow Pages. And a lot of what was in print went elsewhere.
BenedictEvans--04 May-- https://t.co/Le42pCnpPl
BenedictEvans--04 May--I wish Id ordered the Russian with 1 irrigator https://t.co/Ua5ApGnhEo
BenedictEvans--04 May--Metaphor https://t.co/xziobHbmI1
BenedictEvans--04 May--I love the purity of the Donald Judd furniture proposition. 5 pieces of steel bolted together. Made to order, 6 month lead time. Six thousand dollars. US dollars. https://t.co/1AXTCBDHtf
BenedictEvans--04 May--Whats the cool forms service now? (Making an why did you unsubscribe? page)
BenedictEvans--04 May--The best thing about using a third-party twitter client is that twitter rate-limits them. Built-in screen time constraint.
BenedictEvans--04 May--BBC Radio 3 - Late Junction, Circuit-bent radio for people who like art https://t.co/MIrD163DDP
BenedictEvans--04 May--Its kind of interesting that while Apple, Google and FB have totally changed their core concerns in the last decade, Amazon is basically still running a strategy from before some of todays founders were even born.
BenedictEvans--03 May--Today in Bay Area property, this hideous tear-down is $3m https://t.co/jj7FwagmAm
BenedictEvans--03 May--So, this is what a pitch to a VC firm actually looks like. Watch Sandbox VR pitch to us, and what we thought.   https://t.co/dTSBACsGl3
BenedictEvans--03 May--Is it possible to disable twitter DMs entirely?
BenedictEvans--03 May--No, it could not. Next question. https://t.co/CSq6HJ6dWK

BenedictEvans--01 May--Instagram really needs more pictures of Mont St Michel.
BenedictEvans--01 May--Idly occurs to me that Fortnite is a mechanical Turk.
BenedictEvans--01 May--In the 1950s, computers went from architectural scale to furniture scale. (And then in the 80s from furniture to tabletop scale, and in the 2000s from tabletop to personal accessories.)
BenedictEvans--01 May--I wish Id seen Olivettis showroom on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. https://t.co/YBbY3d47HZ
BenedictEvans--01 May--I hope this isnt the next trend after Gofundme
BenedictEvans--01 May--Sometimes using machine learning plus vast amounts of behavioral data to answer a question effectively means youre just running a vast poll. People might lie, or say what they honestly think, but neither might be the truth youre looking for.
BenedictEvans--30 Apr--Orange launched 25 years ago. Still a fantastic piece of advertising.  https://t.co/tTEt83Qlii
BenedictEvans--30 Apr--Thinking more about newsletters. Both the form and the content ('you missed this') react to broken distribution and information overload. Of course they will inevitably have the same no-one goes there anymore - its too crowded problem, even before the gmail algo hides them 1/
BenedictEvans--30 Apr--This weeks newsletter just went out to 116k subscribers.  https://t.co/FZf19oDkfa
BenedictEvans--30 Apr--Unpopular opinion: there is a large element of moral panic to the whole screen time thing.
BenedictEvans--30 Apr--I have questions. https://t.co/Akn4V46g8m
BenedictEvans--30 Apr--Google Pixels are good phones. But they do not sell in significant numbers, not least because google has not driven distribution and not put hundreds of millions or billions of dollars behind them. At one point Samsung was spending close to $10bn on phone marketing.
BenedictEvans--29 Apr--The problem with looking at maps on the wrong scale. https://t.co/B02EFybYcG
BenedictEvans--29 Apr--Thought experiment: what happens to land used for parking once AV means that zoning laws no longer require it? Is it worth more (you can do more productive things with it), less (glut of ex-parking lots), more (higher density cities) less (AV shuttles lead to lower density)
BenedictEvans--29 Apr--Has anyone seen John McAfee lately? https://t.co/cAPa9cBksU
BenedictEvans--29 Apr--Bezos charts are spreading. https://t.co/16Mhpp8enH

BenedictEvans--28 Apr--The Life Of Pitti Peacocks - (evergreen) https://t.co/PbDogatgZG
BenedictEvans--28 Apr--The App Store argument is not actually very interesting. We had it a decade ago and said everything then (and it turned out Apple was right). What IS interesting is that a national politician thinks there are votes in picking up what used to be a inside-tech, geeky argument.
BenedictEvans--28 Apr--A hill I will die on: curated apps stores, with platform owners making decisions around things that will not be allowed at all, are a massive step forward and have huge benefits to actual users, for security, privacy, ease of use and safety.
BenedictEvans--28 Apr--Wondering quite what it meant to say there were 150 political newspapers in Paris in 1904 https://t.co/h4PiBhbbyE
BenedictEvans--28 Apr--Never mind screen time, we need a way to reduce child time. https://t.co/gdgzH5b5bN

BenedictEvans--28 Apr--TIL: there were no computers in 1978. https://t.co/76QDZZH8HR https://t.co/4jw0GnP78h
BenedictEvans--28 Apr--By definition, any app that lets you fight phone addition orcontrol your childrens internet use requires invasive access to everything on your phone by a third-party company. It needs to see everything you do. 1/3 https://t.co/VyeWhzE20Q
BenedictEvans--27 Apr--Twitter is a daily reminder that many people would not pass the Turing test.
BenedictEvans--27 Apr--Belarus Building Site Yields the Bones of 1,214 Holocaust Victims - The New York Times https://t.co/ix58QwaPu8
BenedictEvans--27 Apr--The people I went to university with, who nonchalantly said oh, Im not computer-literate, are now authors, columnists and mid-ranking politicians who find themselves called upon to have opinions about the role of technology and the things it can and cannot be made to do.
BenedictEvans--27 Apr--Books about 2019 https://t.co/UZNxYLqYnY
BenedictEvans--27 Apr--TIL: Office had 3,500 separate commands in 1997. I wonder how many Facebook (basically, Office for consumers) has today.
BenedictEvans--26 Apr--Explain Googles messaging app strategy would be a great interview question.

BenedictEvans--25 Apr--Tesla, software and disruption  I wrote this about Tesla last summer. I dont think much has changed.  https://t.co/ABokigmNSi
BenedictEvans--25 Apr--Volcanic eruption from space  https://t.co/srieyH62Wo
BenedictEvans--25 Apr--Sometimes I think Jeff Bezos has a retailing textbook from about 1978 locked in a safe in his office, and every page has a post i-it note, and every post-it is a project inside Amazon.
BenedictEvans--25 Apr--Best book you can buy about Amazon. https://t.co/nLeHqBQoIE
BenedictEvans--25 Apr--The great thing about newsletters is theres no algorithm between you and the reader. Also, a small change to my newsletter layout pushed the open rate down by 15%.
BenedictEvans--25 Apr--Google is the new Microsoft and Microsoft is the new IBM.
BenedictEvans--25 Apr--Things I dont understand about San Francisco: entire neighborhoods full of huge, old, very expensive houses with no outside space at all. In London those houses would all have 50 foot gardens, and London has worse weather. Is there a law you have to build on the whole plot?
BenedictEvans--25 Apr--L5 is getting to be almost as fuzzily defined as 5G.
BenedictEvans--24 Apr--Email apps should have a F*CK YOU! button that doesnt actually send the message.
BenedictEvans--24 Apr--It always fascinates me how many of twitters mechanics might as well be specifically designed to draw out the worst in us. https://t.co/vaadGcvaGU
BenedictEvans--24 Apr--Much as Amazon is a great company, it did not invent private label products. They began in the 19th century,  and every big retailer on earth does them. This is a total red herring.
BenedictEvans--24 Apr--Voice and the uncanny valley of AI. I wrote this, expressing my skepticism of voice UIs, two years ago. I think Id say the same today. Useful, but very limited. https://t.co/EiFOydWwVb
BenedictEvans--23 Apr--The problem with hardware is that the smartphone supply chain (both components and contract manufacturers) made getting from zero to one really easy. Its getting from 1 to 10,000 thats hard.
BenedictEvans--23 Apr--I would never have guessed Paul &amp; Virginia was still popular in the 1890s https://t.co/fbs3LyRAWl
BenedictEvans--23 Apr--Today in crimes with no exit strategy.  https://t.co/WUILzazdZY
BenedictEvans--23 Apr--I have 8 voicemails from someone trying to sell me a list of sales leads. That of itself probably proves theyre not very good.
BenedictEvans--23 Apr--Full self-driving doesnt mean it probably crashes a bit less often than people. It means it doesnt have a steering wheel.
BenedictEvans--22 Apr--The gap in public versus industry perception around Tesla is fascinating. A lot of people outside tech think Tesla is way out in front on autonomy. Vastly fewer people in the field think so. Regardless of who is right, cant recall many other examples of such a big gap.
BenedictEvans--22 Apr--This weeks newsletter just went out to 115,838 people. https://t.co/FZf19oUVDK

BenedictEvans--21 Apr--I know its hard to cover tech in a generalist newspaper, but can we please try to do better than this?  What does Google is going to encrypt Chrome mean? What would it mean? Please tell me this isnt the discovery of HTTPS, 25 years after the event? https://t.co/0vcvGP7l9j
BenedictEvans--20 Apr--It seems to me there are two misconceptions about AI bias or ML bias: That non-ML systems are any easier or more practical to understand than ML systems. That bias in ML systems will only be human biases, relating to human diversity. Neither of these is really correct 1/2

BenedictEvans--16 Apr--Lazyweb; which was the Primo Levi story about a canning plant in Russia? I read it ages ago and cant find it.
BenedictEvans--16 Apr--Sometimes under-appreciated point about autonomous vehicles: a model might learn a lot more from doing a complex scenario 500 times in simulation (or 500 generated variations of it) than from driving down a straight empty road 500 times in real life.
BenedictEvans--16 Apr--My newsletter went out at lunchtime today. Check your spam folders.
BenedictEvans--16 Apr--If 500m people open Apples App Store every week, is there any other form of media that has that reach? And it is media now, subtly, with a point of view thats not just about tech.
BenedictEvans--16 Apr--Idly occurs to me that when we say AI bias were also describing an absence of bias. The system makes no assumptions at all about what is or is not in the data or what it should or should not be looking at.
BenedictEvans--15 Apr--Proposing a general rule: any article that uses the term AI and never uses machine learning (or some variant) will not have sound conclusions.

BenedictEvans--14 Apr--Part of the challenge in AI ethics  is working out the right level of abstraction to think about. A gun kills people, but machine tools do not. Nazis used punch cards but so did everyone else. So what are neural networks? Pattern recognition? Face recognition? Or a database?
BenedictEvans--14 Apr--End of the beginning. https://t.co/Lm4AzTbteO

BenedictEvans--13 Apr--The thing that interests me about all the Netflix (and Disney D2C) conversations is that none of this has much to do with tech. These are all LA questions, not SF questions. Netflix is a tech company but none of the questions that matter are about tech.
BenedictEvans--13 Apr--I wrote last year that Teslas production hell was a red herring (for both bulls and bears) - disrupters do have to learn the old thing, but that doesnt tell you whether the new thing theyre proposing  is actually disruptive or whether incumbents can doing too 1/
SirajRaval--28 May--It was a pleasure speaking to my friend @lexfridman on his podcast! I revealed more about myself here than in any other conversation so far. Worth a watch! https://t.co/GNqI61tJOn
SirajRaval--28 May--AI still suffers from 3 major limitations! It's vulnerable to adversarial examples, lacks causal reasoning, and needs to be made more explainable. I'm going to detail each of these limitations, then show you how you can earn money solving these https://t.co/qHQlijFKrI
SirajRaval--28 May--We are entering a new era of human evolution fueled by rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence. From deep learning for drug discovery to smart drones for wildlife preservation, the possibilities are truly limitless. Lets build this future together, its ours to create! https://t.co/rQZFtsJn89
SirajRaval--27 May--In 1997, IBM's 'Deep Blue' AI defeated Gary Kasparov, a Chess grandmaster. This was a significant milestone for AI. What is the 'Deep Blue' moment for human intelligence augmented by AI? My bet is that it's going to be in drug discovery and it'll happen in the next 5 years.
SirajRaval--27 May--The future of education in the short term is freely accessible, accredited, world-class educational content across every discipline. In the long term, it's a noninvasive device that gives us write access to our brain, which we can use to download decades of knowledge instantly.
SirajRaval--27 May--Tomorrow Ill release a video titled The Limits of Artificial Intelligence.
SirajRaval--26 May--Were going to need government regulation to 1) Ensure tech monopolies optimize for human well-being, not attention 2) Reduce CO2 emissions (avoid climate catastrophe) 3) Provide a basic income to ensure the gains in automation benefit everyone, avoiding extreme income inequality
SirajRaval--26 May--New discoveries in AI, Neuroscience, Genetics, Pharmacology, Materials Science, Crypto, Quantum Mech, &amp; Materials Science will enable us to engineer 1) Brain device for knowledge download 2) True VR 3) Faster computers (DNA+quantum) 4) robust encryption 5) cures for all diseases
SirajRaval--26 May--We havent yet properly approximated the relationship between value generation and capital allocation. For example, some companies that pollute the environment get paid to do so. Thats why cryptocurrency fascinates me, it enables us to engineer novel incentive structures.
SirajRaval--26 May--The more compassionate scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and technologists we have working for the betterment of humanity, the faster well evolve. That means a more intelligent, introspective, thoughtful, cultured, curious, open minded, and kinder population.
SirajRaval--21 May--Who else knows this feeling...  https://t.co/RRLe0eZyX3
SirajRaval--21 May--These are 10 techniques that I personally use to learn complex topics as fast as possible. Some of these, like cardio learning, i've never talked about publicly before. I hope you find it useful in your learning journey!    https://t.co/YLlrWisMsE
SirajRaval--20 May--In 24 hours Ill release a video that details how I personally learn difficult topics in math and Science really fast. I cant wait to share!
SirajRaval--20 May--Just because I built an open source tool, does not mean its no longer a viable startup idea. Its the execution, not the idea that matters the most. Rebrand my ideas and code as your own engineering solution to make a profitable business. I will rejoice in your success!
SirajRaval--20 May--EssayBrain is an open source tool that I built to automatically grade &amp; validate student essays. It uses a language model to discern whether a document was created by an AI or a human &amp; also assigns it a quality score. I'll explain how it works here!  https://t.co/l8tIRYAjPY
SirajRaval--16 May--I'm working on a tool for teachers that automatically grades essays using modified versions of popular language models, specifically BERT and GPT-2. Expect a video tutorial + demo in 5 days titled "Watch Me Build an Education Startup"!
SirajRaval--16 May--If you dont know, now you know. https://t.co/eAKsZUb4CQ
SirajRaval--15 May--I'm seeing a lot of skepticism from Physicists around my "Learn Physics in 2 Months" curriculum. Machine Learning enables people to make scientific discoveries without needing as much domain knowledge. See my lecture at CERN last year for an example https://t.co/dHaicR8TYx
SirajRaval--14 May--The goal of knowledge and the goal of selfless service are the same, the wise understand this. Use knowledge as a tool to serve others, and you will always be fruitful and find the fulfillment of your desires. I have absolutely found this to be true in my own life.
SirajRaval--14 May--Scientific discovery &amp; engineering solutions are tools that are used to exploit or empower. Nuclear fission aided warfare (atom bomb), but it was also used as an energy source. AI is used to exploit human emotion by social networks, but also used to save lives via drug discovery.
SirajRaval--14 May--Physics has enabled so much technology! Learning it helps improve the ability to reason from first principles, which helps innovate. It will also prepare you for opportunities in computer engineering &amp; quantum computing. This is my Physics curriculum!  https://t.co/HYejFpDWkS
SirajRaval--13 May--Only TWO DAYS left to enter in for the #AIStartupChallenge and our 2019 Spring Fellowship program! AI Startup Challenge entry form:  https://t.co/Am7qockZRR Spring Fellowship: https://t.co/w6VpeOGbAk

SirajRaval--08 May--"The reason I teach Statistical Mechanics is not for you, it's for me. I love teaching it.  I teach it over &amp; over &amp; over again. My life has consisted of repeatedly learning &amp; forgetting it. So heres my opportunity to learn it again." - Prof. Susskind https://t.co/Q3ZK0aZ7bw
SirajRaval--07 May--Advances in Quantum Biology will have a huge impact in Physics &amp; Quantum Machine Learning. There is sound evidence for quantum coherence in photosynthesis &amp; quantum tunneling in enzyme action. The question is now how quantum phenomena affect biology, rather than if they do.
SirajRaval--07 May--General Relativity explains macroscopic interactions. Quantum Field Theory explains microscopic interactions. But the 2 theories are mutually incompatible, they cant both be right. Efforts to unify them into a theory of everything are very exciting. Were getting closer!
SirajRaval--07 May--22 equations define so much of modern Physics - Newtons 3 laws of motion (Classical Mech), Einsteins 10 field equations (General Relativity), the 4 laws of thermodynamics (Statistical Mech), Maxwells 4 equations (Electromagnetism) &amp; Schrodingers equation (Quantum Mech).
SirajRaval--07 May--This is a recap of FutureFest, School of AI's first ever conference! People flew in from all over the world to spend 3 days learning, educating, and envisioning what a positive AI future looks like. Get to know our community in this video #futurefest https://t.co/wRfOs7kNt2
SirajRaval--06 May--This is a cryptocurrency trading bot I've been working on called "GradientTrader"! It uses a cutting edge Deep Reinforcement Learning technique called "Multi Agent Actor Critic" to automate the trading process, I'll explain it here https://t.co/iRPu9QodEV
SirajRaval--05 May--Its incredible how applicable Calculus is to so many seemingly disparate fields. The same techniques used to find the growth rate of Bacteria (Biology) can be used to find the direction to learn for neural nets (Computer Science) &amp; the acceleration of a moving object (Physics)
SirajRaval--03 May--I'm currently studying my own Physics curriculum that's teaching me (in order) Classical Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Special Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity, &amp; Quantum Field Theory. Would it be helpful for me to share? 300 RTs &amp; I will.
SirajRaval--01 May--School of AI is now accepting applications for our 2019 Research fellows! We're going to give 10 Fellows 1K USD, a personal adviser, and a support network to enable them to make discoveries in this incredible field. https://t.co/w6VpeOGbAk

I invited Deans and Wizards from all over the world to learn, grow, and get inspired. It went amazingly well! Ill share an educational video of the event soon #futurefest https://t.co/22IdMXpgtA
SirajRaval--27 Apr--Formal education will enable you to earn a stable income. Self-education will enable you to amass a fortune
SirajRaval--26 Apr--Algorithms govern so much of our lives and dating is no exception! In this video, I frame dating as a data science pipeline and demonstrate how to use AI algorithms to help facilitate discovery, first impressions, and even intimacy.
SirajRaval--24 Apr--I created an app designed for medical professionals to scale and improve the accuracy of their diagnoses using AI. From ideation, to logo design, to integrating features into a single app, I'll show you my 10 step process in this video. 
SirajRaval--23 Apr--I've built an app called Artificial Advisor, your own financial assistant! It's a chatbot that links to your bank &amp; answers questions about your budget. It also makes investments for you based on your interests. In this lecture, i'll explain how I built it https://t.co/78qb6Bbt4F
SirajRaval--22 Apr--I've built an app called VectorFunnel that uses AI to automatically score leads for sales &amp; marketing teams (and charges for it!). I used React + Node + TensorflowJS + PostgresQL as the building blocks. I explain my code &amp; thought process in this lecture https://t.co/yUQKd3qdS8
SirajRaval--17 Apr--Amazon is sucking up $20 billion in business every year, putting 30 percent of American malls out of business, and they paid $0 in federal taxes in 2018. The AI revolution has only just begun, let's all benefit from it. Basic income isn't right or left, it's forward! #YangGang https://t.co/86XcZRF8eo
SirajRaval--16 Apr--I've split this episode's predictions into 3 parts - AI hardware, AI software, and AI's impact on society. This really stretched my imagination, and I did my best to ground it in as much current scientific literature as I could! https://t.co/jHZlnWmgXK I'll review every submission . This is your time to shine, good luck Wizards! #AIStartupChallenge https://t.co/RC49ettqAA
SirajRaval--10 Apr--Next week, I'll release an episode titled "AI in 2040". A few notable topics include neuromorphic computing, quantum feature mapping, mind-body machine interfaces, basic income, and the future of meaningful work in a world where all current jobs are automated.
SirajRaval--09 Apr--Tensorflow 2.0 has major upgrades that you should know about! I built a transformer network in TF 2.0 that predicts asset prices using the Yahoo Finance API. Then, I used its predictions to make automated investment decisions for any user. See how I did it https://t.co/fdMyNWxSkj
SirajRaval--08 Apr--An excellent opportunity to work on the most exciting project in human history. Definitely apply if you've got what it takes! https://t.co/lm09qPxN55
SirajRaval--08 Apr--I've built an app called MindRelaxr that provides users with an on-demand therapist chatbot trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I'll demo how I used PyTorch + Tensorflow + ONNX + Android + Dialogflow + Paypal + Firebase to build it in this lecture https://t.co/x8mGQ0RxXq
SirajRaval--07 Apr--Imagine https://t.co/y7w9vR69Z2
SirajRaval--07 Apr--In 14 hours, I'll release a video lecture titled "Build an AI Startup with PyTorch". Together, we'll build an automated therapist app called MindRelaxr that demonstrates the full Machine Learning pipeline (training, payments, user auth, deployment, design, etc.) Get hype! https://t.co/KiJZ9Rerol
SirajRaval--07 Apr--I never graduated from Columbia, i'm a college dropout. And I've always stubbornly refused to get a PhD despite my parents wishes. Self directed learning will be valued more &amp; more while college degrees will be valued less &amp; less. The Internet is my University, make it yours too!
SirajRaval--04 Apr--My prediction for AI in 20 years - Wearable mind-body machines have replaced smartphones. We leverage quantum entanglement for zero latency communication, quantum optimization techniques are ubiquitous, &amp; DNA is used for computing + storage. Humans are vastly smarter + kinder.
SirajRaval--02 Apr--Now is the time to build an AI startup! The ecosystem has matured, the 4 pillars of AI are now freely accessible Data - Kaggle, Google Dataset Search Algorithms - Arxiv, GitHub Compute - Google Colab, Kaggle Kernels Education - School of AI, KhanAcademy, Fast .AI
SirajRaval--02 Apr--AI is currently helping humans discover compatible relationships &amp; its getting better over time. In this episode, I demonstrate how techniques like collaborative filtering, text classification, &amp; even text generation are being used in the dating industry https://t.co/kzV9Bxc0S3
DavidHeinemeierHansson--29 May--Most people associate successful immigration with complete cultural assimilation. As an immigrant to the US, theres nothing I fear more from my migration than to be completely assimilated in American culture.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--28 May--Maybe this will be what finally makes my Twitter sabbaticals stick. https://t.co/marEudTXkT
DavidHeinemeierHansson--28 May--Heres the thing about being rich: You dont have to personally be a saint with how you spent your spoils to see that the economic system in the US is badly broken and getting worse. And upon seeing that, advocate for change and heightened scrutiny of wealth.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--27 May--The acquisition graveyard claims another victim. https://t.co/1w0P6wcoNd
DavidHeinemeierHansson--27 May--I like this memorial ode a lot better than the bullshit about how the sacrifices were about protecting our freedoms. You can acknowledge military service without rationalizing invasions and occupations under such a tortured banner as for freedom. https://t.co/125Kij0MFN
DavidHeinemeierHansson--27 May--How long until journalists and privacy advocates start rejecting Facebooks hiring offers and organizational donations on the same accord? Rooting lungs is bad. So is rooting brains. https://t.co/KnBVnz9GoS
DavidHeinemeierHansson--27 May--I agree the privilege smudge can get a bit much at times, but this is some grade-A privilege laundering. Conflating common concerns of wealth and hereditary social class with imaginary concerns against existing. Dont mind the gaps here, we are all just alive, amiright?! https://t.co/tcPR5P8H0i
DavidHeinemeierHansson--26 May--Software has been eating the world alright. The financiers of such software consumed the bulk of the nutrients, and the rest of the world was left with the excrements. Talk about a shit show.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--23 May--"That idea, that maybe things like our gaming devices or the websites we visit should be created by people we know and like, instead of giant faceless companies, seems more essential than ever", https://t.co/D3zYeNNgN0
DavidHeinemeierHansson--23 May--The road to hell is paved with good intentions. https://t.co/A6hc9PUbCJ
DavidHeinemeierHansson--23 May--Most importantly, this helps to change the open source narrative: you shouldn't feel like you need to work for free, especially if companies are actually making money off of your work., I swear I didnt have a crystal ball for my RailsConf keynote  https://t.co/xA8nul7iZT
DavidHeinemeierHansson--21 May--Keynote on the topic of open source, markets, debts, purpose, and no less than the meaning of life. Delivered at RailsConf 2019. Also available as a long read. https://t.co/yf3PD47fTY
DavidHeinemeierHansson--20 May--Basecamp has been paying at the top 10% of San Francisco market rates for a while now (based on pay + bonus, but not stock options). That's been working great for a lot of roles, but now we've taken one step further and raised our min pay to $70K too. https://t.co/07BfkBp33G
DavidHeinemeierHansson--17 May--(On a Twitter hiatus. Only popping in rarely. If you need to reach me, try email. I'll be back next month(?).)
DavidHeinemeierHansson--17 May--We're hiring a Director of Operations at @Basecamp to lead our team of seven on ops, juggling our own servers and cloud setups. Come help us strive for uptime 9s while keeping calm and building a resilient ops culture  https://t.co/t7QH5GeOqN
DavidHeinemeierHansson--13 May--Uber stock was decimated this morning. Down 11%. Now valuing the company at about half of what bankers thought they could get out of the market just a few months ago. Good luck to all those employees who swallowed their ethics to work for Uber on the promise of  IPO 
DavidHeinemeierHansson--13 May--The most beautiful Uber would be the one that atoned for its sins by flaming out spectacularly. And in its ashes made room for a sustainable alternative paying living wages to employed drivers, owned the cars, followed regulations, and didnt kill people with half-baked robocars.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--12 May--Heres your human recommendation engine: If you liked Evening Chill on Spotify, youre going to like Study Beats on Apple. Apples curated playlist game has taken a big step forward since launch  https://t.co/i1vm1euSyW
DavidHeinemeierHansson--12 May--Last box packed. End of 14 years in Chicago. What a city 
DavidHeinemeierHansson--12 May--To pull it off, she works 20 to 22 hours a day. (A few times a month, when she feels the crunch, she spends a full 24 hours at her desk.), how gullible do you have to believe such self-torturous fantasy? 2-4h per day for food/bathrooms/sleep? Sure... https://t.co/DjJpL8Onco
DavidHeinemeierHansson--11 May--Since Apple is so into services now, Id recommend exploring iRage  a grueling anger management class that tests you to the limit. Itll be cheap for them to run too. All thats required is having patrons try to do anything at the Apple Store at all. Buy, service, return.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--10 May--Keeping the Nest data separate from Google was a big concession made when Google bought the company, designed to allay privacy fears. Now that that is going away https://t.co/382mCOAopg
DavidHeinemeierHansson--09 May--Class-action lawsuit regarding the failing MacBook keyboards is seeking more data on the problem. You can help by sharing your experience. https://t.co/cKrXo9njw4
DavidHeinemeierHansson--09 May--Facebook has violated your privacy too many times. Mark Zuckerberg must go. https://t.co/XkN9qQW06z
DavidHeinemeierHansson--08 May--America. Justifying the virtue of rich people by making up stories about their immense, personal sacrifice. The world is full of poor people who are also sleep-deprived, and suffer the health and mental consequences for it, but they rare use the fact as some fucking trophy. https://t.co/lHMwH7L3oo
DavidHeinemeierHansson--07 May--Denver is voting on decriminalization of psilocybin. Fingers crossed! Marvelous step forward if this passes. https://t.co/9qLRudjvJo
DavidHeinemeierHansson--05 May--When we keep advocating for the debt that open-source users supposedly owe to maintainers, the door is wide open for charlatans to prey on the guilt. Python is not the only community to have been hit with this, but what a sad story none the less. https://t.co/jC4cIby9iW
DavidHeinemeierHansson--05 May--Instead of Uber being complicit in the exploitation of this, as Chen calls it, underclass, theyre actually doing you a favor by facilitating conversations! Dont say they are not merciful. Its underclass interactions as a service. Christ. https://t.co/IhBDGy7CgZ
DavidHeinemeierHansson--05 May--uBiome was raided by the FBI for ripping off patients and insurers with bogus medical tests. This is what #GrowthUberAlles looks like when applied to medicine. Working hard to provide unicorn returns for Andreessen Horowitz and YCombinator  https://t.co/WBFCUNAgex
DavidHeinemeierHansson--04 May--Reading through the heartbreaking stories in this thread is in itself a trauma. Any presidential candidate that does not have plan for radical reform of the US healthcare system needs to sit down and let someone who does have a go. https://t.co/QUnxzMCG4h
DavidHeinemeierHansson--03 May--The problem with many arguments is that theyre really just justifications for feelings. Just embrace your feelings, and forgo the need to constantly dress them up in logically sounding arguments.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--03 May--Stripes approach of treating Remote as its own hub within a company thats traditional been in-office only is really smart. Great model for other larger companies that got started before Remote got as good and as easy as it is today. https://t.co/Gd7daHfdQd
DavidHeinemeierHansson--30 Apr--Nothing quite as invigorating of purpose as seeing a ballroom full of new Rails developers and meeting old friends at the same time. Thanks for entertaining my dramatic reading this morning #RailsConf 
DavidHeinemeierHansson--30 Apr--To unsubscribe from the Marriot email list all you have to supply is this. Surprised theres no demand for a human sacrifice to be thrown in for good measure. https://t.co/qaM5xSn4Jq
DavidHeinemeierHansson--29 Apr--Newspaper wont let you cancel your subscription online? @Marriott takes this to the next level: CANT CANCEL EMAIL LIST SUBSCRIPTION ONLINE! https://t.co/1yOmsTJvdL
DavidHeinemeierHansson--29 Apr--Someone should do a scientific study on how many Bitcoin HODLers also happen to be Elon Musk megafans. Im just so curious to learn whether its 99.6% or 99.8%.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--27 Apr--Apples continued capricious, opaque administration of the App Store is scandalous and a stain on the company. May @ewarrens call to prevent tech companies from competing against their own stores become law! https://t.co/LCXICEAPYO
DavidHeinemeierHansson--26 Apr--Zuckerberg is like really, totally worried about what might happen to everyone's Facebook data if it got into the hands on some scary foreign leaders. Just let him have it all, and he'll protect it real good. https://t.co/J6OLEi0sOn
DavidHeinemeierHansson--26 Apr--"Saying our stablecoin is backed 1:1 by USD in a bank is not quite the same as saying our stablecoin is backed by an equal notional amount of 3-year dollar-denominated loans to our affiliated crypto exchange, much of whose cash is currently frozen"  https://t.co/r7klxSjoLb
DavidHeinemeierHansson--26 Apr--Amazon has granted the Taylorism machines that monitor shipping-center productivity the right to automatically fire workers it deem slacking, without a need for supervisor input . The algorithms are literally in charge here.  https://t.co/xYVbxnqCCv
DavidHeinemeierHansson--26 Apr--"These keyboards are the biggest mistake in Apples history", https://t.co/X2tN4HzOnx
DavidHeinemeierHansson--25 Apr--Android devices arent kept up to date... And despite multiple attempts by Google to rectify the situation, its been getting worse for years. https://t.co/MNAE6LbFwo
DavidHeinemeierHansson--24 Apr--Tesla lost $702m last quarter. Has $2.2b left in cash (of which $768m is deposits!). And expects to continue losing money this quarter. I'm sure this has nothing to do with "every other car is a horse" and "self-driving is here!!" statements from Musk. https://t.co/LpyusYh9jQ
DavidHeinemeierHansson--24 Apr--Release candidate for Rails 6 is out! It includes Action Mailbox, Action Text, multi-db support, parallel testing, Webpacker-by-default, and so much more. Already running at @basecamp, @github, @shopify in production  https://t.co/Pxs28jPQ8q
DavidHeinemeierHansson--23 Apr--Puma starting in single mode... Version 3.12.0 (ruby 2.6.2-p47), codename: Llamas in Pajamas I kinda love watching the Ruby community age. Codenames are no longer just Hitchhiker references, but now children's books  https://t.co/24ihZOvFHT
DavidHeinemeierHansson--23 Apr--Google is retaliating against organizers of the November walkout: "My manager started ignoring me, my work was given to other people, and I was told to go on medical leave, even though Im not sick", https://t.co/GTxuqytm7B
DavidHeinemeierHansson--23 Apr--I really want this to be true. I don't think it'll be true at all. But I really want it to be! https://t.co/bO3FXbUn0f
DavidHeinemeierHansson--23 Apr--Parisian publication Business Digest is doing a story on "It Doesn't Have To Be Crazy At Work", and would like to talk to a biz owner or manager who've put some of the ideas in practice. If that's you and you'd like to help the message, shoot me an email david@basecamp.com 
DavidHeinemeierHansson--21 Apr--Every episode of Dirty Money on @netflix is worth watching, but given how the US healthcare system is finally under serious review for radical reform, none is more timely than EP3: Drug Short on Valeant and prescription drug price gouging 
DavidHeinemeierHansson--21 Apr--Silicon Valley had come to small-town Kansas schools  and it was not going well https://t.co/yX9GpddRFk
DavidHeinemeierHansson--19 Apr--This is truly amazing work by @lastweektonight. https://t.co/cfvTQYTGwJ
DavidHeinemeierHansson--19 Apr--"We are sending data about you to just about every other company in the world. We track you with 179(!!) different cookies, of which 29 we don't even know what to call. Here are your options about this: ALLOW ALL. Sincerely yours, @outline"  https://t.co/1PLBx6FQed
DavidHeinemeierHansson--19 Apr--This would be real progress. Like counters, follower counters, and all the other forms of bragging metrics on social media are a pox upon us all. https://t.co/i1850bz9Kn
DavidHeinemeierHansson--18 Apr--The new "responsible growth" mission at YouTube sounds an awful lot like "clean coal". A branding exercise aimed at providing cover while the existing operation continues to extract as much as possible, until real change is forced upon it. https://t.co/dqhL1wLPNe
DavidHeinemeierHansson--18 Apr--Without obscurity, we wouldnt have the freedom to take risks, fail and dust ourselves off. Wed be stymied by the fear of being deemed failures by a system that never forgets, https://t.co/auma3as8ld
DavidHeinemeierHansson--17 Apr--"With Luxafor, productivity is the name of the game. We identified the main reasons for drops in productivity, and fitted all the solutions in this tiny gadget", @voozahq is branching into products! This is almost as good as those horse-face blinders. https://t.co/fRrRElGzwg
DavidHeinemeierHansson--16 Apr--"The ideological underpinnings of capitalism are already in an advanced state of ethical decay. You dont save the good parts of said capitalism by doubling down on the worst, most exploitive parts. Racing to the bottom just gets you there faster.", https://t.co/zSdjpSY7Fk
DavidHeinemeierHansson--16 Apr--Gotta give it to @jason. At least he's consistent in his abhorrent odes to overwork . It's only been a bit over a decade he called for bosses to "fire people who are not workaholics" https://t.co/40BMrRcpNk
DavidHeinemeierHansson--16 Apr--Google is quietly disbanding it's UK AI healthcare-review panel after members refused to rubber-stamp work without access to proper information, have independence, or have their recommendation be binding. https://t.co/5vkRUKJK9z
DavidHeinemeierHansson--16 Apr--What's funny about US tax system is that it's possible to pay EU rates at top end. My estimated taxes for 2019 are around 52%. Within spitting distance of income taxes in Spain (52%) or Denmark (52-55%). Just earn your money as income rather than cap gains and live in CA.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--16 Apr--What I find curious about the most ardent defenders of the American interpretation of capitalism is how the bar for comparison is always failed communist states in South America or Eastern Europe, never prosperous socialist democracies in Western Europe.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--16 Apr--Most Americans would be so lucky as to have a EU-style retirement life. One where work stops after 40 hours, where growth isnt uber alles, and where wealth isnt monopolized by a tiny elite, and China isnt used as a boogeyman to ramp up exploitation. https://t.co/4YiamGpVXD
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Apr--This is just the worst. Figure heads accept accolades on behalf of team efforts all the time. I continue to get a lot of credit for Rails development, even if my percentage of new code has never been lower. Fuck this. https://t.co/6jfXPFQn86
DavidHeinemeierHansson--14 Apr--When autocratic regimes reserve all growth and wealth for the aristocracy, we cheer when the other 90% take to the streets to demand reforms. When it happens in the US, thats just capitalism doing its thing  nothing to see, nothing to be done! https://t.co/zcL52pkwai
DavidHeinemeierHansson--13 Apr--Privacy is not about hiding or concealing wrongdoing; its about comfort and control of your personal life, essential take-down of the depressingly common and trite arguments for why you should care/fight for privacy  https://t.co/fcLg7VLKVe
DavidHeinemeierHansson--13 Apr--Google is letting law enforcement trawl for suspects by asking who was in this area, during this time?. Google has the location records of hundreds of millions of people going back years. Seriously disturbing. https://t.co/FkRNVBA6ra
DavidHeinemeierHansson--13 Apr--The reason small companies created by idealists too frequently turn into consumer-defrauding forces for evil has to do with the amount of profit each new phase of investor expects to receive, @zeldman is on  and the mob metaphor for VC is . https://t.co/TTHZVER49k
DavidHeinemeierHansson--12 Apr--To be able to work 996 is a huge bliss, Chinas richest man said. If you want to join Alibaba, you need to be prepared to work 12 hours a day, otherwise why even bother joining. - rich boss wants poorer employees to work harder, news at 11! https://t.co/M1qiJEtfUX
DavidHeinemeierHansson--12 Apr--You have every right to be skeptical of an ex-McKinsey, Harvard educated, Rhode Scholar candidate for president. And you should keep that skepticism sharp, but I dare you to read an interview with Buttigieg and not come away impressed. https://t.co/3v1QHfyswU https://t.co/3KHkTX1UyF
DavidHeinemeierHansson--12 Apr--The revelation that Amazon has workers around the world listening in on Alexa  and either being amused or disturbed by what they hear (and passing clips around the office)  is frequently met with WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED? Same weak response the NSA revelations got 
DavidHeinemeierHansson--12 Apr--4G in Spain . On a lowly iPhone SE. Damn. https://t.co/6iLk781fcU
DavidHeinemeierHansson--11 Apr--Whats the point of muting people on Twitter if the service continues to goat you into checking whatever inane shit they have to say now? I muted because I wasnt fucking interested. Do we really need a SUPER-MUTE-LIKE-FOR-REAL button on top @jack? https://t.co/H8VQUQItw4
DavidHeinemeierHansson--11 Apr--Berating people for not tipping enough in the US, fine. Lining up behind the trope that the dystopian American system of letting patrons set wages for service staff because thats how you incentivize great service? Get the fuck outta here. https://t.co/h6juzRXssN
DavidHeinemeierHansson--11 Apr--Chinese tech workers are organizing to fight 996. Chinese tech giants are responding by blocking access to organizing website. Who do you think Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital is cheering for in this fight? https://t.co/90epvTSWXT
DavidHeinemeierHansson--11 Apr--"We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles", says Ford CEO. If only Musk could be as honest about Tesla's ludicrous claims of totally self-driving cars by next year's end. https://t.co/uHUuwoZ1zj
DavidHeinemeierHansson--11 Apr--An army of Amazon workers around the world listen to and transcribe what users tell Alexa (whether its by intent or by accident). The most interesting/intimate recordings are, like with the NSA, shared amongst colleagues for support or laughs. https://t.co/w5VzRueEgH
DavidHeinemeierHansson--10 Apr--As long as youre stuck on a quest for that one super-power practice or North Star principle, youre not going to make space in your brain for the fact that no individual secret is going to make the difference. Only compound wisdom will. https://t.co/sEldoLr66H
DavidHeinemeierHansson--10 Apr--As China looks to fight air pollution, it eyes banning Bitcoin crypto-mining, as it deems it "seriously wasted resources", generating 10m tons of CO2/year. https://t.co/DzQllllJ0l
DavidHeinemeierHansson--10 Apr--"Theres some pain that needs a solution, and some pain that needs a story", well-put introduction to logo therapy (Man's Search for Meaning) and stoic framing, even if it never calls out those terms. https://t.co/cGmiZYUYVA
DavidHeinemeierHansson--10 Apr--Textbook case of state capture. Depressing. Did you know that the majority of Danes don't even have to manually file a tax return, unless they have amendments to what the government already knows about their income and assets? https://t.co/r2OXSNc5yC
DavidHeinemeierHansson--10 Apr--"...as the companys co-founder Sebastian Thrun seeks to bring costs in line with revenue without curbing growth" reminds me of the racing trade-off joke: "Go as fast as possible but don't crash the car". Well, yeah. https://t.co/9fLb6MZMOT
DavidHeinemeierHansson--09 Apr--Satellite radio and newspapers are notorious for making it excruciatingly painful to cancel your subscription. That's complete bullshit, so @reworkpodcast got on the case of trying to learn more about this dark pattern used by @wsj, @siriusxm, @FT, etc. https://t.co/d9hZo76sSL
DavidHeinemeierHansson--07 Apr--The Formula 1 Drive to Survive series on @Netflix is the most exciting, exhilarating sports docu-drama Ive ever seen. Phenomenal editing, access, and storytelling. I wish actual F1 races were this edge-of-your-chair . Seriously good. No need to be a race fan to appreciate it.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--05 Apr--So Ive been rocking the iPhone SE for a few days. Absolutely love it. But the battery life seems surprisingly poor? This was a brand-new model from Apples clearance sale, but could the battery have gone bad just sitting in the box for 2+ years since manufacture?
DavidHeinemeierHansson--04 Apr--"You Are Not Google" is the kind of technical common sense that depressingly frequently loses the battle against developer ego and aspirations. https://t.co/Tx0Dvel0RM
DavidHeinemeierHansson--04 Apr--Youre typing it wrong really is some peak Apple apologia. Not sure youre holding it wrong can even compete there. https://t.co/wuJOwCWUCm
DavidHeinemeierHansson--04 Apr--Ive been getting a flood of direct feedback on the MacBook keyboard fiasco, but this account from a student who was told by the Genius Bar that his busted keyboard was because he was typing too hard takes the cake. Guy now getting a PC after five repairs. Infuriating.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--03 Apr--Even when you're a US citizen, even when you have Global Entry, you can still be detained, harassed, and threatened at the border at the capricious leisure of immigration agents, if you refuse to unlock your electronics on their unjustified whims. https://t.co/pTvvjqjOcj
DavidHeinemeierHansson--03 Apr--I had the same conversation with an Apple genius about a iPhone repair. It seems bizarre that the standard response to but what will I do without my device? is buy another and return it. How does that even work for Apple? Refurb cant be cheap. https://t.co/zkbVAgH9yJ
DavidHeinemeierHansson--03 Apr--The iPhone SE arrived and the first impression is how impressive it is that Apple fit so much usable power in such a small device. If this had actually come out after the big slabs of glass, we'd be cheering their miniaturization prowess!
DavidHeinemeierHansson--03 Apr--Great piece on wealth by an heiress to a family fortune. https://t.co/VNuoFAakx9
DavidHeinemeierHansson--02 Apr--Curious what the hiscore for keyboard replacements is for a single person? Opening the bid at 4. Comment in the thread if you can beat it  https://t.co/WfvfydZvwI
DavidHeinemeierHansson--01 Apr--This poll has remained remarkably stable all the way from 200 responses up to 3,400. ~37% have no issues with their keyboard, ~50% are suffering from busted keyboard without addressing it with Apple, and just 11% have taken theirs in for repairs. https://t.co/R3Vxm2ijQO
DavidHeinemeierHansson--01 Apr--Another thought: Keep hearing "Apple actually does know the keyboard failure rates are extreme, but they can't say due to [image/lawsuits/capitalism]". That's an even worse conclusion: Apple knowingly lying. I'm pretty cynical, but not (yet) that cynical re: Apple.
DavidHeinemeierHansson--01 Apr--Tesla's autopilot could be tricked into driving into on-coming traffic by a few stickers. Yeah, there's no fucking way we have "go to sleep in your car, wake up at destination" any time soon. https://t.co/yE4OrT1Efv
DavidHeinemeierHansson--01 Apr--After three iterations and years of spectacular failures, this isn't a problem you can pin on one individual or even a group. This is a systemic failure of analysis, wishful thinking (membranes!!), and contingency planning. When it's this bad this long, the buck stops at the top. https://t.co/YXZpY8eyjE
DavidHeinemeierHansson--01 Apr--This thread pinpoints exactly how Apple ended up with the calamity that is computers where half the keyboards end up breaking. They only analyzed the return data, not what people were living with and not reporting. This fiasco is going to be a HBR Quality Case Study. https://t.co/xYDGCSeqdT
DavidHeinemeierHansson--01 Apr--Nearly half of all the 3rd-generation, membrane-enhanced keyboards in the 2018+ MacBooks are failing at Basecamp. This is not "a small number". It's a catastrophe and Apple should do a total recall. https://t.co/LxxbCcpZOK
DavidHeinemeierHansson--01 Apr--This is how IE used to look (and for a while it was even worse). But if you take this as a signal that you should give up on developing for the web and instead just develop for Chrome, you're part of the problem. Be part of the solution. https://t.co/ckaVrbi5er
DavidHeinemeierHansson--01 Apr--Front app isn't a Chrome specific app. The support agent just got it wrong. You can see how they'd be forgiven for making such a mistake as the Chrome monoculture spreads. But good on Front for supporting web apps, not chrome apps. https://t.co/pUlq2adYUJ
DavidHeinemeierHansson--01 Apr--Medium is really turning the thumbscrews in service of their subscription scheme. https://t.co/bXofZQTCrb
DavidHeinemeierHansson--01 Apr--This is how it spreads. Google normalizes web apps that are really just Chrome apps. Then others follow. Weve been here before, yall. Remember IE? Browser hegemony is not a happy place. https://t.co/b29EvIty1H
